1
00:01:05,748 --> 00:01:08,651
Valhalla, this is Thor.
Valhalla, this is Thor.

2
00:01:08,751 --> 00:01:12,179
We have visual on
a possible high-value target.

3
00:01:12,279 --> 00:01:13,722
Thor, this is Valhalla.

4
00:01:13,822 --> 00:01:15,399
We're seeking positive ID...

5
00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:17,309
on target traveling
in convoy...

6
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:20,522
and we're pushing
more assets your way.

7
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,741
Contact Loki on secondary net.

8
00:01:23,841 --> 00:01:25,841
Loki, this is Thor.

9
00:01:25,884 --> 00:01:28,273
Target is located at
grid coordinates...

10
00:01:28,373 --> 00:01:30,030
two-four-Tango-Kilo-Bravo...

11
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,458
one-two-four-five-si
x-seven-three-niner.

12
00:01:33,558 --> 00:01:35,293
Confirm you have visual.

13
00:01:35,393 --> 00:01:36,753
Verifying target ID.

14
00:01:36,853 --> 00:01:38,913
Electro-optic and
infrared sensors are online.

15
00:01:39,013 --> 00:01:43,513
- Confirming target.
- SecDef is arriving now.

16
00:01:50,691 --> 00:01:53,591
Mr. Secretary, this way, sir.

17
00:01:57,489 --> 00:01:59,015
Attempting cell phone link
to moving target.

18
00:01:59,115 --> 00:02:01,415
Stand by for data feed.

19
00:02:03,827 --> 00:02:05,229
Stand by for audio.

20
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:07,329
Got it.

21
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:10,152
Now, don't tell me you
spotted the beard...

22
00:02:10,252 --> 00:02:11,953
in the middle of a
goddamn sandstorm.

23
00:02:12,053 --> 00:02:13,233
- Is it really him?

24
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,289
We're confirming
that now, sir.

25
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:16,450
Sir, audio is coming up now.

26
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,503
- Verifying voice
pattern match.

27
00:02:18,603 --> 00:02:20,494
What do we have
here, Sergeant?

28
00:02:20,594 --> 00:02:22,773
Four males. One of
them is speaking...

29
00:02:22,873 --> 00:02:24,172
in a Rakhshani dialect,

30
00:02:24,272 --> 00:02:28,072
consistent with our
intel on al-Khoei.

31
00:02:29,435 --> 00:02:31,212
Sir, it's just coming up.

32
00:02:31,312 --> 00:02:33,174
'Thirty-seven percent'
and 'probable'...

33
00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:34,849
don't belong in
the same sentence.

34
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:36,476
I'm not taking this
to the President.

35
00:02:36,576 --> 00:02:39,646
CIA and NCTC concur
it is the target,

36
00:02:39,746 --> 00:02:41,556
based on reliable
intel from the Brits.

37
00:02:41,656 --> 00:02:44,856
They're pulling
off the highway.

38
00:02:59,965 --> 00:03:01,575
Criteria is not met.
Recommend abort.

39
00:03:01,675 --> 00:03:03,452
We have an abort
recommendation.

40
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,748
If it's him, this guy
comes out of hiding...

41
00:03:05,848 --> 00:03:07,330
every couple of years at best.

42
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,630
Sir, target is appearing
around the northeast corner.

43
00:03:13,518 --> 00:03:14,570
We've got AK-47s,

44
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,889
RPGs and Chaparral
guided missiles.

45
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,757
This is a training
camp, Mr. Secretary.

46
00:03:18,857 --> 00:03:22,152
- Wait. Wait. Print. 51%.
- 51%.

47
00:03:22,277 --> 00:03:23,453
- Abort rec still holds.

48
00:03:23,553 --> 00:03:25,138
All other PID
options exhausted.

49
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:28,338
What do you
suggest we do, sir?

50
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:31,019
Is that a weapons cache?

51
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:33,104
Sir, the placement of
the stones around the pit,

52
00:03:33,204 --> 00:03:35,356
marker for the five
pillars of Islam.

53
00:03:35,456 --> 00:03:36,774
I think it's a funeral.

54
00:03:36,874 --> 00:03:38,242
For Christ's sake.

55
00:03:38,342 --> 00:03:40,512
Counsel, how many
ways would this...

56
00:03:40,612 --> 00:03:42,412
violate the Geneva Convention?

57
00:03:42,512 --> 00:03:44,456
We can invoke hors de combat.

58
00:03:44,556 --> 00:03:46,157
There's no independent
intel verifying...

59
00:03:46,257 --> 00:03:47,535
that this is, in
fact, a funeral.

60
00:03:47,635 --> 00:03:52,635
Signal's got the President
from Air Force One, sir.

61
00:03:59,354 --> 00:04:00,630
Mr. President,

62
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,558
we have a 51% identity match
on Majid al-Khoei.

63
00:04:04,658 --> 00:04:06,141
The bad news is, there's...

64
00:04:06,241 --> 00:04:08,178
some possibility
he's at a funeral.

65
00:04:08,278 --> 00:04:09,905
You should also be aware...

66
00:04:10,005 --> 00:04:11,942
we have an abort
recommendation.

67
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:15,310
But the Joint Chiefs
are urging a go.

68
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,210
All right, what's
your recommendation?

69
00:04:23,668 --> 00:04:25,813
Sir, we measure success by...

70
00:04:25,913 --> 00:04:28,739
the least amount of
collateral damage.

71
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:33,176
At 51% probability,
the risk is too high.

72
00:04:33,301 --> 00:04:36,751
And if it is al-Khoei
and he walks.

73
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:39,920
I'm putting our
people at risk.

74
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,020
You have a go.

75
00:04:45,063 --> 00:04:47,563
Thank you, Mr. President.

76
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,271
- We're weapons hot.
- We have weapons hot.

77
00:04:53,371 --> 00:04:54,705
- Loki, you are
cleared to engage.

78
00:04:54,805 --> 00:04:55,773
Repeat, weapons hot. PID.

79
00:04:55,873 --> 00:04:57,252
We have handshake with the

80
00:04:57,352 --> 00:04:59,226
MQ9 Reaper. Sending
you images now.

81
00:04:59,326 --> 00:05:02,980
- Loki, target
coordinates received.

82
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,426
Yes, sir. Switching
to IR sensor.

83
00:05:11,797 --> 00:05:13,797
Target is lased.

84
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,294
Master arm on.

85
00:05:17,394 --> 00:05:19,394
Missiles away.

86
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:25,299
Ten seconds to impact.

87
00:05:47,496 --> 00:05:50,192
You got to make
a choice, fellas.

88
00:05:50,292 --> 00:05:54,754
Who are you going
to be? Boys or men?

89
00:05:58,174 --> 00:05:59,617
- I'm out on this one.
- Why?

90
00:05:59,717 --> 00:06:02,086
- 'Cause I'm broke.
- Come...

91
00:06:02,186 --> 00:06:03,829
How do I know you don't have
something great under there?

92
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:04,544
Kwame just paired the board.

93
00:06:04,644 --> 00:06:05,330
I'm floating on
the river here.

94
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,506
Look at the table.

95
00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:08,080
I don't know. I'm
supposed to take my...

96
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,501
girl out later. It's
a lot of money.

97
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:12,721
Your girl out? Who's that?

98
00:06:12,821 --> 00:06:14,338
- Elaine?
- Yeah.

99
00:06:14,438 --> 00:06:16,508
You guys have been going out
for a while.

100
00:06:16,608 --> 00:06:17,968
How long?

101
00:06:18,068 --> 00:06:20,345
- Couple months.
- Couple months? Wow.

102
00:06:20,445 --> 00:06:23,137
- That's big. You have
sex with her yet?

103
00:06:23,237 --> 00:06:23,598
Kinda.

104
00:06:23,698 --> 00:06:25,024
- What the hell is 'kinda'?
- 'Kinda'?

105
00:06:25,124 --> 00:06:26,359
- Personal question.
- Okay, well, listen.

106
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:27,412
Let me ask you a question.

107
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,736
What are you going
to do tonight?

108
00:06:28,836 --> 00:06:29,812
Fish fillet and a Coke?

109
00:06:29,912 --> 00:06:31,531
Go to Blockbuster,
rent a little romantic comedy,

110
00:06:31,631 --> 00:06:33,315
go back to Mom's house,
sit on the couch?

111
00:06:33,415 --> 00:06:34,741
- How'd you know?
- Well, that's what you do.

112
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:35,575
You're a dependable person.

113
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:36,526
That's what you're
going to do.

114
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:38,203
You know what you should do?

115
00:06:38,303 --> 00:06:39,640
You need to lay down
some real green...

116
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,614
and treat your lady right.

117
00:06:40,714 --> 00:06:42,583
You know, you need to take her
to a nice place.

118
00:06:42,683 --> 00:06:45,827
Red Lobster. Olive Garden.
Tablecloths. Soft music.

119
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:47,879
And then you skip
this Blockbuster thing.

120
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:49,667
Girls want to go out.
Especially a girl...

121
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:50,999
as cute as your
girl, you know?

122
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:53,093
She wants to be seen.
That's why she dresses up.

123
00:06:53,193 --> 00:06:54,718
So you take her to the movies.

124
00:06:54,818 --> 00:06:55,919
- A little
popcorn-drink combo.

125
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:56,378
True. True.

126
00:06:56,478 --> 00:06:57,922
Elaine might want a
hot dog and some...

127
00:06:58,022 --> 00:06:59,465
nachos, so you shell
out for that, too.

128
00:06:59,565 --> 00:07:00,975
And then before you know it,

129
00:07:01,075 --> 00:07:02,268
she's cozying up
the way she never would've...

130
00:07:02,368 --> 00:07:03,469
at her mom's house, you know?

131
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:04,979
- Preach it. Preach it.
- Now all of a sudden, look.

132
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:07,439
Gino Romero's walking tall
with Elaine yank-my-Dickinson,

133
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:08,898
- all because he dared
to dream tonight.

134
00:07:08,998 --> 00:07:09,441
Yes. Yes. Yes.

135
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:10,734
And he became a man.
And that's the choice.

136
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:11,037
- Yes.

137
00:07:11,137 --> 00:07:12,394
And that's what's
on the table.

138
00:07:12,494 --> 00:07:14,896
This is the dream right here.

139
00:07:14,996 --> 00:07:16,355
Are you a man?

140
00:07:16,455 --> 00:07:17,615
- I'm with you.
- Okay, here we go.

141
00:07:17,715 --> 00:07:18,983
- I'm with you. Twenty?
- Twenty.

142
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,083
Big boy game.

143
00:07:21,294 --> 00:07:22,779
Call.

144
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,071
- Cowboys over aces, big Jer.
- Wow. Wow.

145
00:07:25,171 --> 00:07:26,656
- Didn't see that coming, huh?
- Yeah, that's a tough one.

146
00:07:26,756 --> 00:07:28,868
This is a tough one, too.
Four bullets, baby.

147
00:07:28,968 --> 00:07:29,716
Get out of here.

148
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,662
You baited me into
that, Jer. Come on.

149
00:07:31,762 --> 00:07:32,587
- That's the way it goes.

150
00:07:32,687 --> 00:07:33,756
So what happened
to Red Lobster?

151
00:07:33,856 --> 00:07:35,465
No, I guess it's Mama's house
for you tonight.

152
00:07:35,565 --> 00:07:36,800
But look, I saved
you 40 bucks.

153
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,113
And now Elaine won't
have to shell out...

154
00:07:39,213 --> 00:07:40,378
for herpes medication.

155
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:41,394
Break's over, bitches.

156
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:42,806
Freitag missed
his shift again.

157
00:07:42,906 --> 00:07:44,091
- Someone's on collator duty.
- Great.

158
00:07:44,191 --> 00:07:46,050
All right, well, gentlemen.

159
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,569
I'll give you a chance
to win some of...

160
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:48,978
this back tomorrow.
Enjoy yourselves.

161
00:07:49,078 --> 00:07:51,078
All right, man.

162
00:07:55,951 --> 00:07:57,576
Hey there. Welcome
to Copy Cabana.

163
00:07:57,676 --> 00:07:58,562
How can I help you?

164
00:07:58,662 --> 00:08:00,823
I couldn't get the machine
past the main menu.

165
00:08:00,923 --> 00:08:02,566
- That machine there?
- Yeah.

166
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,619
Did you swipe your credit card
to the left, sir?

167
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:06,494
- Didn't do that.
- Well, that's your problem.

168
00:08:06,594 --> 00:08:09,294
Why don't you try it again?

169
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:20,175
Cell phone users, beware.

170
00:08:20,275 --> 00:08:22,323
The Federal Bureau
of Investigation...

171
00:08:22,423 --> 00:08:24,471
can now hear everything
you're saying,

172
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,755
even when your cell
phone is turned off.

173
00:08:26,855 --> 00:08:28,514
Authorities can now activate...

174
00:08:28,614 --> 00:08:30,384
the microphone
inside your phone,

175
00:08:30,484 --> 00:08:33,312
allowing them to eavesdrop
on you and your conversations.

176
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:36,318
Experts say the only
way around this...

177
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:39,475
is to take the battery
out of the device.

178
00:08:39,575 --> 00:08:40,822
- The death toll
now stands at 14.

179
00:08:40,922 --> 00:08:41,978
Now arriving at Union Street.

180
00:08:42,078 --> 00:08:43,063
- Stand clear of the doors.
- Excuse me.

181
00:08:43,163 --> 00:08:45,563
Watch your step, please.

182
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,166
Did you drop this?

183
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,488
Yes.

184
00:08:52,588 --> 00:08:55,048
- It's hard to do on
a train, you know.

185
00:08:55,148 --> 00:08:55,999
Doors closing.

186
00:08:56,099 --> 00:08:58,299
Standing passengers...

187
00:08:59,219 --> 00:09:01,819
Come on, come on, come on.

188
00:09:44,429 --> 00:09:46,121
Jerry?

189
00:09:46,221 --> 00:09:47,623
Mrs. Wierzbowski.
I was just...

190
00:09:47,723 --> 00:09:49,500
I thought you might
have been sleeping.

191
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,001
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- So... But I have...

192
00:09:51,101 --> 00:09:52,928
I have some rent here.

193
00:09:53,028 --> 00:09:53,603
- Here you go.

194
00:09:53,703 --> 00:09:55,172
Yeah, some is good.
All is better.

195
00:09:55,272 --> 00:09:57,132
Well, that's most of it. Here.

196
00:09:57,232 --> 00:09:58,550
$1, $1, $1...

197
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,219
No, no, no. Look.
Here's a five there.

198
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,446
- Five.
- Yeah.

199
00:10:02,571 --> 00:10:04,565
Where is girl? I
don't see her no more.

200
00:10:04,665 --> 00:10:06,900
You know you're the
only woman for me.

201
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,810
No, that's done.
She got smart.

202
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,437
- Like the others.
- Yeah. Yeah.

203
00:10:11,537 --> 00:10:13,482
Is woman friend? Answer.

204
00:10:13,582 --> 00:10:16,858
Then see if she give
you money for rent.

205
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,958
One second.

206
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,670
Hey, Mom.

207
00:10:24,842 --> 00:10:26,842
What?

208
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:56,886
- Looks just like him.
- I'm not him.

209
00:12:35,632 --> 00:12:38,375
Six months without
a boo or a bah, huh?

210
00:12:38,475 --> 00:12:40,044
Yes, sir.

211
00:12:40,144 --> 00:12:42,944
So where were you this time?

212
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:48,142
Alaska. Singapore.
I got a job there.

213
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:55,275
I... I spoke to Stanford.

214
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,385
I pulled some strings.

215
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:57,389
They said they'd
take you back.

216
00:12:57,489 --> 00:12:58,269
Even though you took off...

217
00:12:58,369 --> 00:12:59,562
Two years ago, Dad.

218
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:01,660
Jerry, you know, it
wouldn't kill you...

219
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,349
to ask for help
once in a while.

220
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,684
You want to have
this conversation now?

221
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,944
- It's Stanford.
- You want to do this today.

222
00:13:06,044 --> 00:13:07,019
You know how many
people would kill...

223
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,959
- Today? You want
to have this now?

224
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:09,279
Fine.

225
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:13,479
You do whatever you want.
You always have.

226
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,578
You know, I keep thinking,

227
00:13:21,678 --> 00:13:24,161
I'm going to walk
in here one day...

228
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,871
and I'm not going to feel...

229
00:13:26,971 --> 00:13:30,171
like a stranger
in my own house.

230
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,840
I don't want your money.

231
00:14:08,886 --> 00:14:11,463
Can I have your
attention, please?

232
00:14:11,563 --> 00:14:15,313
Smoking is not
permitted on the train.

233
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:17,413
Chicago is next.

234
00:14:35,578 --> 00:14:38,481
Can't find the keys
and he's late as usual.

235
00:14:38,581 --> 00:14:41,188
- I'm going to
have to take you.

236
00:14:41,288 --> 00:14:42,401
He'll be here.

237
00:14:42,501 --> 00:14:44,495
All right, wait
five more minutes.

238
00:14:44,595 --> 00:14:46,655
Help me out here.
We came home last night.

239
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:47,899
I put the leftovers down.

240
00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:49,573
You turned on the
TV. I went over,

241
00:14:49,673 --> 00:14:53,327
said, 'No TV, no TV, no TV.'
Turned it off.

242
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:54,505
Came over here.

243
00:14:54,605 --> 00:14:56,590
- Checked the messages.
- Knocked over the phone.

244
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:59,092
Right, knocked over the phone.
Put it back.

245
00:14:59,192 --> 00:15:02,392
Put the leftovers
in the fridge.

246
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:06,465
Let's go.

247
00:15:06,565 --> 00:15:07,879
I put vitamins in
your toiletry bag.

248
00:15:07,979 --> 00:15:08,801
Don't forget to take...

249
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:10,087
- Two in the morning
and two at night.

250
00:15:10,187 --> 00:15:10,560
That's right.

251
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,678
And your inhaler's
in the back of your bag.

252
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:12,846
- Sammy.
- Daddy.

253
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:13,947
Come here. You didn't think

254
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:15,515
I'd miss the big
send-off, do you, huh?

255
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:16,858
Let's get you on this train.

256
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,644
- This must be your...
- Trumpet.

257
00:15:18,744 --> 00:15:19,885
My God, this weighs,
like, 200 pounds.

258
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:20,687
You carry this yourself?

259
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:22,480
- Mr. and Mrs. Holloman.
- Miss.

260
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,190
- You just made it.
- Right.

261
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,742
- Here, Sam.
- Thanks.

262
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:26,860
- Listen to me.
- I have one more here.

263
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,268
All these other kids,
right? They're...

264
00:15:28,368 --> 00:15:29,745
going to call their
moms, too, all right?

265
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,488
They're just going
to lie about it.

266
00:15:31,588 --> 00:15:33,128
All right, and eat junk
food 'cause this is...

267
00:15:33,228 --> 00:15:34,492
your one chance, but
brush your teeth.

268
00:15:34,592 --> 00:15:37,828
Mom, you got to stop.
I'm going to miss you, too.

269
00:15:37,928 --> 00:15:39,537
Capitol Limited to D.C. is
departing now.

270
00:15:39,637 --> 00:15:40,713
Give me a hug.

271
00:15:40,813 --> 00:15:41,831
All aboard.

272
00:15:41,931 --> 00:15:45,419
- I love you so much.
- I love you, too.

273
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,319
- Shine bright, okay?
- Okay.

274
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:49,518
Rock the house, buddy.

275
00:15:49,618 --> 00:15:50,631
You're going to
be great. Okay?

276
00:15:50,731 --> 00:15:52,008
- Okay.
- I'll see you later.

277
00:15:52,108 --> 00:15:54,727
- Bye.
- Have fun in D.C..

278
00:15:54,827 --> 00:15:57,513
- Bye, Mom.
- Your mom going to be okay?

279
00:15:57,613 --> 00:15:59,613
It's unclear.

280
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:01,275
I'm so sorry. I got
stuck in traffic,

281
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:05,575
- and I didn't even...
- Don't even say it.

282
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:07,481
All aboard.

283
00:16:07,581 --> 00:16:10,081
Yes. Five-nine-one-three.

284
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,939
It's here. It's here.

285
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:22,009
Okay, okay.

286
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,710
- Come on.
- Two seconds. Sorry.

287
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,410
No, wait.

288
00:16:57,837 --> 00:16:59,289
- Hey, hang on a second.
- Sorry.

289
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:00,623
- You're dropping money.
- Sir, sir.

290
00:17:00,723 --> 00:17:04,723
Big date, you know?
Fingers crossed, huh?

291
00:17:07,012 --> 00:17:10,213
- Here you go.
Have a good day.

292
00:17:10,313 --> 00:17:12,125
Thank you.

293
00:17:12,225 --> 00:17:13,292
- Jerry.
- What?

294
00:17:13,392 --> 00:17:15,253
- So many boxes.
- Boxes?

295
00:17:15,353 --> 00:17:17,806
I had to open your room.
All day they come.

296
00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:19,307
- Big boxes, small boxes.
- My boxes?

297
00:17:19,407 --> 00:17:20,799
I don't know.
Whose boxes would they be?

298
00:17:20,899 --> 00:17:21,668
- All right, okay.

299
00:17:21,768 --> 00:17:23,219
Look at them there.
See in there?

300
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,687
- See, I put them all...
- Yeah. Yeah.

301
00:17:24,787 --> 00:17:26,309
- Listen, I have
something for you here.

302
00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:26,556
Yeah.

303
00:17:26,656 --> 00:17:28,725
This is rent for this month
and next month, too, okay?

304
00:17:28,825 --> 00:17:30,925
- Oh, my.
- Thank you.

305
00:18:44,145 --> 00:18:45,138
Hello?

306
00:18:45,238 --> 00:18:46,248
The FBI will arrive...

307
00:18:46,348 --> 00:18:47,840
at your apartment
in 30 seconds.

308
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,550
You must flee the premises.

309
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:50,802
Who... Who is this?

310
00:18:50,902 --> 00:18:52,436
You've been activated, Jerry.

311
00:18:52,536 --> 00:18:54,388
- Who the hell is this?
- Your compliance is vital.

312
00:18:54,488 --> 00:18:55,439
How did you get this number?

313
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:58,442
You now have 24 seconds.
Leave your residence.

314
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:00,253
Your destination,
the Mathis train...

315
00:19:00,353 --> 00:19:02,112
station. We will
guide you from there.

316
00:19:02,212 --> 00:19:03,238
What is this?

317
00:19:03,338 --> 00:19:05,524
The evidence in your
apartment is irrefutable.

318
00:19:05,624 --> 00:19:06,608
- Listen.
- 17 seconds.

319
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:07,692
I'm going to hang
this phone up now.

320
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:09,027
They'll seek your arrest
for conspiracy, treason...

321
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:10,060
- I'm hanging this
phone up now.

322
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,154
... violating state
and local law.

323
00:19:11,254 --> 00:19:12,342
- You tell me how
you got this number.

324
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,080
Maximum penalty, death.

325
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,680
No, none of this is mine.

326
00:19:17,301 --> 00:19:20,588
FBI, FBI, FBI. Get
down on the floor.

327
00:19:20,688 --> 00:19:22,688
Get on the ground.

328
00:19:24,015 --> 00:19:25,258
Down now. Get down.

329
00:19:25,358 --> 00:19:27,670
- I didn't do anything.
- Get down.

330
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:28,930
- Listen.
- Don't move.

331
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,930
It's not mine. It's not mine.

332
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:44,852
This is obviously
some sort of mistake, right?

333
00:19:44,952 --> 00:19:46,098
I mean, I don't know...

334
00:19:46,198 --> 00:19:47,863
what I'm doing in
this room, sir.

335
00:19:47,963 --> 00:19:50,563
It's cold as hell outside.

336
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:54,378
- You draw?
- I what?

337
00:19:54,503 --> 00:19:56,934
Do you draw? Do you sketch?

338
00:19:57,034 --> 00:20:00,200
You have ink all
over your fingers.

339
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,869
Look, you know you got
the wrong guy, right?

340
00:20:01,969 --> 00:20:02,140
I mean,

341
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,294
this is all some
kind of sick joke.

342
00:20:03,394 --> 00:20:05,076
- I don't know what
I'm doing here.

343
00:20:05,176 --> 00:20:05,621
Obviously.

344
00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:09,292
Obviously you have
nothing to do with it, yeah.

345
00:20:09,392 --> 00:20:11,992
Did you love your brother?

346
00:20:12,727 --> 00:20:16,627
Or did you hate him?
Did you admire him?

347
00:20:17,358 --> 00:20:21,458
Was your brother patriotic,
would you say?

348
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:26,621
When's the last
time you saw him?

349
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:30,809
- Christmas.
- This past Christmas?

350
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:34,231
- Three Christmases ago.
- Three years, huh?

351
00:20:34,331 --> 00:20:36,110
Well, the phone records
show that you...

352
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,943
haven't even called
him in over a year.

353
00:20:38,043 --> 00:20:40,822
So no text messages?
No smoke signals?

354
00:20:40,922 --> 00:20:42,374
No MySpace or
Facebook messages?

355
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:43,569
Yeah, so what are
you trying to say?

356
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:44,000
We're not...

357
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,242
Are you asking if we're
the type of twins...

358
00:20:45,342 --> 00:20:47,703
that wear the same
shirt to the mall,

359
00:20:47,803 --> 00:20:50,164
hold hands, and
things like that? No.

360
00:20:50,264 --> 00:20:51,664
- Sir, I don't even
know your name.

361
00:20:51,764 --> 00:20:52,999
I'm sorry, that
was rude of me.

362
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:54,250
I'm Tom Morgan,

363
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:57,168
the Supervising Agent assigned...

364
00:20:57,268 --> 00:21:00,173
to the Joint
Terrorism Task Force.

365
00:21:00,273 --> 00:21:02,873
You think I'm a terrorist?

366
00:21:03,318 --> 00:21:04,853
No, you're a copy
boy, aren't you?

367
00:21:04,953 --> 00:21:08,181
- I'm a copy associate.
- Copy associate.

368
00:21:08,281 --> 00:21:09,641
But your brother,

369
00:21:09,741 --> 00:21:11,672
it says here he
was a little more.

370
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:13,936
I guess you'd say,
ambitious than you.

371
00:21:14,036 --> 00:21:16,146
Graduated from
the Air Force Academy at 21,

372
00:21:16,246 --> 00:21:18,081
with an advanced
degree in parallel...

373
00:21:18,181 --> 00:21:19,867
algorithms and
quantum electronics.

374
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:21,206
I don't even know
what the hell...

375
00:21:21,306 --> 00:21:22,203
that stuff means. Do you?

376
00:21:22,303 --> 00:21:23,567
Cadet wing commander,
valedictorian,

377
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:24,821
plum job in the
Public Affairs...

378
00:21:24,921 --> 00:21:26,581
Yeah, no, I know
what he did, sir.

379
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:28,157
Why'd you drop out
of school, Jerry?

380
00:21:28,257 --> 00:21:29,238
Did your brother have...

381
00:21:29,338 --> 00:21:30,619
any influence on
that decision?

382
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:32,046
No, school just wasn't for me.

383
00:21:32,146 --> 00:21:34,631
No, I mean, who would want
a Stanford education anyway?

384
00:21:34,731 --> 00:21:35,949
More upward mobility...

385
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:37,709
at Copy Cabana,
I guess, right?

386
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:40,062
I see you did a
little backpacking.

387
00:21:40,162 --> 00:21:41,888
Singapore, Bali, Indonesia.

388
00:21:41,988 --> 00:21:43,296
Did odd jobs here and there.
So you've been around.

389
00:21:43,396 --> 00:21:44,464
Look, none of this
has anything to do...

390
00:21:44,564 --> 00:21:46,717
with any of the shit
that was in my apartment.

391
00:21:46,817 --> 00:21:48,894
Why would I send it to myself?
My name is on the lease.

392
00:21:48,994 --> 00:21:50,192
I'd have to be the
dumbest terrorist...

393
00:21:50,292 --> 00:21:51,138
in the history of the world.

394
00:21:51,238 --> 00:21:52,681
So who deposited the 750?

395
00:21:52,781 --> 00:21:53,211
The...

396
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:56,059
I don't know who
deposited the 750.

397
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,477
God maybe? I thought
it was a miracle.

398
00:21:57,577 --> 00:21:58,968
I took the money.
That was my mistake.

399
00:21:59,068 --> 00:21:59,738
It was an accident.

400
00:21:59,838 --> 00:22:01,615
Do accidents not happen
in your universe?

401
00:22:01,715 --> 00:22:05,660
Well, the money originated
from the YTBC Bank of...

402
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,737
Well, I'll be
darned, Singapore.

403
00:22:07,837 --> 00:22:09,013
Opened with a transfer from...

404
00:22:09,113 --> 00:22:10,656
a corporation called
The Star of Orion,

405
00:22:10,756 --> 00:22:11,754
- a dummy front for Hezbollah.

406
00:22:11,854 --> 00:22:12,992
This is all very
interesting, sir.

407
00:22:13,092 --> 00:22:14,468
- It has nothing
to do with me.

408
00:22:14,568 --> 00:22:16,128
We find hardware
in your apartment.

409
00:22:16,228 --> 00:22:18,088
Latest military spec.

410
00:22:18,188 --> 00:22:18,617
- Airplane manuals.

411
00:22:18,717 --> 00:22:19,423
I told you about this already.

412
00:22:19,523 --> 00:22:20,494
And 1,200 pounds...

413
00:22:20,594 --> 00:22:22,209
of ammonium
nitrate fertilizer.

414
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:23,294
I walked into my apartment...

415
00:22:23,394 --> 00:22:25,086
You planning on becoming
a farmer or something?

416
00:22:25,186 --> 00:22:27,547
I walk into my apartment,
I open the door,

417
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:28,840
and this shit's all
over my apartment.

418
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,350
- It just showed up.
- It just showed up.

419
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,544
I see. I'm just curious...

420
00:22:31,644 --> 00:22:33,311
if your brother knew
anything about it.

421
00:22:33,411 --> 00:22:35,567
Of course, we haven't
really established...

422
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:37,515
how close you guys
were yet, have we?

423
00:22:37,615 --> 00:22:39,463
Well, we were pretty
close this morning...

424
00:22:39,563 --> 00:22:41,185
when I buried his
body in the ground.

425
00:22:41,285 --> 00:22:42,436
Does that establish
anything for you?

426
00:22:42,536 --> 00:22:43,103
Somebody set me up.

427
00:22:43,203 --> 00:22:44,488
Why is that so hard
for you to understand?

428
00:22:44,588 --> 00:22:44,974
- 'Somebody.'

429
00:22:45,074 --> 00:22:46,065
A woman called
me on the phone.

430
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:47,274
She told me I was
going to be arrested.

431
00:22:47,374 --> 00:22:48,734
'A woman.' Your mom? Who?

432
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:52,984
I don't know. If I
knew, I would tell you.

433
00:22:53,084 --> 00:22:55,084
I don't know.

434
00:22:56,257 --> 00:22:57,867
Here's the thing, Jerry.

435
00:22:57,967 --> 00:23:01,129
This is a bad time to be
in the terrorism business.

436
00:23:01,229 --> 00:23:03,229
You read the paper.

437
00:23:04,222 --> 00:23:06,175
Who do you think is winning?

438
00:23:06,275 --> 00:23:08,774
Your Miranda rights or
my right to keep...

439
00:23:08,874 --> 00:23:11,130
you in this room as
long as I want to?

440
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:14,050
I don't care if you tell me
the truth about your brother.

441
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,385
I don't care who you work for.

442
00:23:16,485 --> 00:23:19,835
'Cause no matter
what you tell me,

443
00:23:19,935 --> 00:23:23,635
you're in a shitload
of trouble, son.

444
00:23:28,329 --> 00:23:31,240
This is insane. I
work for Copy Cabana.

445
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,040
Yeah, that's what you said.

446
00:23:40,674 --> 00:23:42,335
Listen, I get one night out
in a decade, ladies.

447
00:23:42,435 --> 00:23:44,494
I am not wasting
it on Lemon Drops.

448
00:23:44,594 --> 00:23:47,294
- Okay.
- Buck up. Let's go.

449
00:23:52,644 --> 00:23:54,170
Oh, gosh.

450
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,002
I want updates.
Catfights, booty calls,

451
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:57,515
somebody tell me
they got lucky.

452
00:23:57,615 --> 00:24:00,357
Hey, ladies. See
that guy over there?

453
00:24:00,457 --> 00:24:02,595
He'd like to buy you a round.

454
00:24:02,695 --> 00:24:03,094
Hell, no.

455
00:24:03,194 --> 00:24:05,189
He's got light beer
written all over him.

456
00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:06,398
- He's cute.
- Come on.

457
00:24:06,498 --> 00:24:07,566
He's a suit. No.

458
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:08,901
You sure?

459
00:24:09,001 --> 00:24:11,021
- Come on.
- Who is it?

460
00:24:11,121 --> 00:24:14,690
The one man in my life
who hasn't let me down.

461
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,975
- That's sweet.

462
00:24:16,075 --> 00:24:19,318
All right, don't drink
those without me.

463
00:24:19,418 --> 00:24:21,029
Hello?

464
00:24:21,129 --> 00:24:23,129
Hello?

465
00:24:23,298 --> 00:24:25,761
There's a McDonald's
across the street.

466
00:24:25,861 --> 00:24:27,035
Look in the window.

467
00:24:27,135 --> 00:24:28,202
What is this?

468
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:32,102
Would you risk your
life for your son?

469
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:39,388
Rachel Holloman,
you've been activated.

470
00:24:39,488 --> 00:24:41,265
- This isn't funny.
- Your compliance is vital.

471
00:24:41,365 --> 00:24:43,383
- Who are you?
- We will derail his train,

472
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:45,060
unless you do
what you're told.

473
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,144
What is this?

474
00:24:46,244 --> 00:24:48,055
Don't go back inside
the restaurant.

475
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:48,529
- What?

476
00:24:48,629 --> 00:24:50,640
There's a black
Porsche Cayenne...

477
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,477
parked at the northeast corner
of this block.

478
00:24:53,577 --> 00:24:57,877
The keys are in the ignition.
Start walking.

479
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:01,457
Oh, my God.

480
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:04,153
911.

481
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:05,954
State the nature
of your emergency.

482
00:25:06,054 --> 00:25:07,425
Yeah, some woman
just called me.

483
00:25:07,525 --> 00:25:09,074
I have... I have no
idea who she is.

484
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,774
She was telling me that...

485
00:25:15,638 --> 00:25:18,588
Your phone is being monitored.

486
00:25:18,688 --> 00:25:21,888
Disobey again and
your son dies.

487
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,173
Hey, Grant, I can't
read this Shaw file.

488
00:25:26,273 --> 00:25:28,273
- Grant.
- Excuse me.

489
00:25:28,775 --> 00:25:30,243
Listen, my eyes aren't
getting any better...

490
00:25:30,343 --> 00:25:31,604
and these screens
are getting smaller.

491
00:25:31,704 --> 00:25:33,222
Could you please find me
something I can read?

492
00:25:33,322 --> 00:25:34,774
I can make the text bigger
on your screen.

493
00:25:34,874 --> 00:25:36,391
No, no, no. I'm
talking about paper.

494
00:25:36,491 --> 00:25:37,851
Remember, like in
the olden times?

495
00:25:37,951 --> 00:25:39,478
- Paper. Okay.
- Yeah.

496
00:25:39,578 --> 00:25:40,736
Agent Morgan. Zoe Perez,

497
00:25:40,836 --> 00:25:42,448
Air Force Special
Investigations.

498
00:25:42,548 --> 00:25:44,992
Ethan Shaw, the twin,
he was one of ours.

499
00:25:45,092 --> 00:25:45,362
Yeah.

500
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:47,777
OSI said they were
sending a liaison.

501
00:25:47,877 --> 00:25:49,612
Can you walk and talk
at the same time?

502
00:25:49,712 --> 00:25:50,955
I'll do my best.

503
00:25:51,055 --> 00:25:52,949
File says he died in
a traffic accident.

504
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:54,630
Truck ran a light, corner of

505
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,835
Constitution and
10th, Northwest D.C.

506
00:25:56,935 --> 00:25:59,246
So truck ran a light,
his brother gets 750 large...

507
00:25:59,346 --> 00:26:01,508
and enough hardware
to start his own Costco,

508
00:26:01,608 --> 00:26:04,052
five hours after enemy
chatter hits the roof.

509
00:26:04,152 --> 00:26:06,011
I mean, don't you find that
a little coincidental?

510
00:26:06,111 --> 00:26:10,272
What if it's a decoy?
To distract us from...

511
00:26:10,372 --> 00:26:12,972
something 50 times bigger.

512
00:26:22,493 --> 00:26:25,479
- Time for your phone call.
- I thought I didn't get one.

513
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:29,979
Attorney General's office
changed their mind.

514
00:26:30,334 --> 00:26:32,571
Ethan Shaw had a 183 IQ...

515
00:26:32,671 --> 00:26:34,989
and yet you had him
as a mid-level press flak.

516
00:26:35,089 --> 00:26:36,656
Why not IT or cyber-warfare?

517
00:26:36,756 --> 00:26:38,825
Are you suggesting
that he was overqualified?

518
00:26:38,925 --> 00:26:40,476
Or that he was somehow
slipping intel...

519
00:26:40,576 --> 00:26:41,286
to the Copy Cabana?

520
00:26:41,386 --> 00:26:43,171
No, I'm suggesting
that maybe Ethan Shaw...

521
00:26:43,271 --> 00:26:46,148
was a superstar rocket
scientist genius...

522
00:26:46,248 --> 00:26:47,383
who did go wrong,

523
00:26:47,483 --> 00:26:49,025
and the Air Force doesn't want...

524
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:51,054
their dirty laundry
flapping in the wind.

525
00:26:51,154 --> 00:26:53,134
Think what you like,
but I need to get in...

526
00:26:53,234 --> 00:26:54,891
that room and
interrogate him myself.

527
00:26:54,991 --> 00:26:56,991
No.

528
00:27:04,783 --> 00:27:07,068
You don't have a choice. Look.

529
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:08,690
Now, neither of us
know if either of...

530
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,271
those brothers are
guilty or innocent,

531
00:27:10,371 --> 00:27:12,691
so on behalf of the Secretary...

532
00:27:12,791 --> 00:27:15,778
of the Air Force, I'm
going in that room.

533
00:27:15,878 --> 00:27:16,860
Well, on behalf of...

534
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,580
all that fucking
bomb equipment...

535
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:23,180
in junior pinhead's apartment,
no, you're not.

536
00:27:31,141 --> 00:27:34,503
We told you to run.
We have planned your escape.

537
00:27:34,603 --> 00:27:36,505
How'd you get on this phone?
Who are you?

538
00:27:36,605 --> 00:27:38,431
Lay flat on the
floor immediately.

539
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:38,809
What the...

540
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:39,932
What the hell are
you talking about?

541
00:27:40,032 --> 00:27:41,176
Four seconds, Jerry.

542
00:27:41,276 --> 00:27:42,789
- No, this is
bullshit. I don't...

543
00:27:42,889 --> 00:27:43,437
Get down now.

544
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:45,537
Two seconds.

545
00:28:08,092 --> 00:28:10,092
No.

546
00:28:12,514 --> 00:28:15,914
- No. I didn't do this.
- Get down.

547
00:28:20,437 --> 00:28:22,437
Shit.

548
00:28:55,304 --> 00:28:57,254
Standing passengers,

549
00:28:57,354 --> 00:29:01,054
please do not lean
against the doors.

550
00:29:04,062 --> 00:29:05,734
... fourteen Americans dead...

551
00:29:05,834 --> 00:29:07,965
throughout Europe
and the Middle East,

552
00:29:08,065 --> 00:29:10,885
with terror groups insisting
this is just the beginning...

553
00:29:10,985 --> 00:29:12,971
of a campaign the West invited...

554
00:29:13,071 --> 00:29:15,056
when it allegedly
rained bombs...

555
00:29:15,156 --> 00:29:16,472
on a religious ceremony...

556
00:29:16,572 --> 00:29:18,150
outside the small
town of Abda,

557
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:21,350
near the border
of Afghanistan.

558
00:29:31,754 --> 00:29:33,778
Stay on the train for
three more stations...

559
00:29:33,878 --> 00:29:35,667
and wait at the bottom
of the platform.

560
00:29:35,767 --> 00:29:37,767
You will receive...

561
00:29:59,113 --> 00:30:02,563
Doors closing.
Standing passengers,

562
00:30:02,663 --> 00:30:06,363
please do not lean
against the doors.

563
00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:32,553
- Help.
- Jimmy.

564
00:30:32,653 --> 00:30:36,558
My baby. I need some
help. Somebody.

565
00:30:36,658 --> 00:30:38,268
- What?
- You're not listening.

566
00:30:38,368 --> 00:30:40,052
We told you to
stay on the train.

567
00:30:40,152 --> 00:30:42,847
- How are you doing this?
- Next stop is Wilson Station.

568
00:30:42,947 --> 00:30:44,351
A black Porsche
Cayenne will be...

569
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:45,683
waiting at the northwest exit.

570
00:30:45,783 --> 00:30:47,235
- Listen.
- Get in the passenger seat.

571
00:30:47,335 --> 00:30:49,869
Listen. No, I'm done.

572
00:30:51,871 --> 00:30:52,425
- Hello?

573
00:30:52,525 --> 00:30:55,191
The man in front of
the exit door...

574
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:57,777
in a black coat is
a wanted terrorist.

575
00:30:57,877 --> 00:31:01,777
- His name is Jerry Shaw.
- Who is this?

576
00:31:03,758 --> 00:31:04,751
- You Jerry Shaw?
- No, no, no.

577
00:31:04,851 --> 00:31:07,245
Wilson Station. Exit now.

578
00:31:07,345 --> 00:31:09,345
That's the guy.

579
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:15,048
I said, are you Jerry Shaw?
Hey. Come here.

580
00:31:35,872 --> 00:31:37,872
Watch it.

581
00:31:42,127 --> 00:31:43,324
- Drive the car.
Drive the car.

582
00:31:43,424 --> 00:31:43,495
No.

583
00:31:43,595 --> 00:31:44,444
- I did what you
asked me to do.

584
00:31:44,544 --> 00:31:45,197
I'm not going anywhere...

585
00:31:45,297 --> 00:31:45,770
- You tell... Stop.

586
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:46,782
...until you tell
me my son's safe.

587
00:31:46,882 --> 00:31:47,361
Who's your son?

588
00:31:47,461 --> 00:31:48,785
I don't know what
you're talking about.

589
00:31:48,885 --> 00:31:49,920
- I'll kill you if
you hurt my son.

590
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,869
I almost died over this shit.

591
00:31:50,969 --> 00:31:52,050
- Listen, lady, I
don't know who...

592
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:52,746
Tell me Sam is safe.

593
00:31:52,846 --> 00:31:54,247
Who is... Will you
stop hitting me?

594
00:31:54,347 --> 00:31:56,958
Are you the woman
who called me on the phone?

595
00:31:57,058 --> 00:31:58,606
- Did you call
me on the phone?

596
00:31:58,706 --> 00:31:59,378
No. The woman.

597
00:31:59,478 --> 00:32:00,962
- She called you, too?
- She called you, too?

598
00:32:01,062 --> 00:32:03,062
Drive.

599
00:32:04,732 --> 00:32:08,432
Get out. Now. Get
out of the vehicle.

600
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:10,819
Stop.

601
00:32:17,411 --> 00:32:19,530
- Why is this happening?
- Go, go, go, go, go.

602
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,531
Who are you and
why are people shooting at us?

603
00:32:21,631 --> 00:32:23,992
Drive the car. Clutch.

604
00:32:24,092 --> 00:32:26,352
Accelerate. Turn
right, 200 feet.

605
00:32:26,452 --> 00:32:27,662
You have pursuers.

606
00:32:27,762 --> 00:32:31,448
- Yeah, no shit. Who are you?
- No questions.

607
00:32:31,548 --> 00:32:33,548
Turn right now.

608
00:32:39,766 --> 00:32:41,000
So you don't know
anything about Sam?

609
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,002
What, you mean your son?
No, I know nothing.

610
00:32:43,102 --> 00:32:44,053
Just like you don't
know how to drive.

611
00:32:44,153 --> 00:32:45,140
Use the clutch
before you shift,

612
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:45,838
not while you shift.

613
00:32:45,938 --> 00:32:47,006
I don't need driving lessons
from you, asshole.

614
00:32:47,106 --> 00:32:49,008
What, you drive like this
and I'm the asshole?

615
00:32:49,108 --> 00:32:51,108
Turn left now.

616
00:32:58,282 --> 00:33:00,157
All units. Suspect
in a Porsche

617
00:33:00,257 --> 00:33:02,070
Cayenne heading west on Grand.

618
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:05,770
- All units respond, Code 3.
- There.

619
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,416
Maintain a speed of
50 miles an hour.

620
00:33:12,516 --> 00:33:14,581
Stay in the second
lane from the right.

621
00:33:14,681 --> 00:33:18,181
- The light's red.
- Accelerate now.

622
00:33:27,477 --> 00:33:29,671
Get me a roadblock
at Granville and Sheridan.

623
00:33:29,771 --> 00:33:31,771
Oh, shit.

624
00:33:34,483 --> 00:33:37,783
The lights are
all turning green.

625
00:33:41,489 --> 00:33:43,489
Holy shit.

626
00:33:57,088 --> 00:33:59,088
- Holy...
- Shit.

627
00:34:02,134 --> 00:34:04,134
Get in close.

628
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,679
Go, go, go.

629
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:12,643
- Shit.
- Brake. Brake now.

630
00:34:13,311 --> 00:34:15,311
Get in here.

631
00:34:24,238 --> 00:34:27,438
Accelerate to 60
miles per hour.

632
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:31,410
Clutch. Clutch.

633
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,938
- Use the clutch.
- I'm clutching.

634
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:36,538
I'm watching, you're
not clutching.

635
00:34:38,752 --> 00:34:41,352
- Stop.
- I'm not stopping.

636
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,950
Slow down. Slow down,
the light's red.

637
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,009
Don't slow down.

638
00:34:46,109 --> 00:34:48,078
Accelerate to 72
miles per hour.

639
00:34:48,178 --> 00:34:50,080
- Slow down. It's a red light.
- You will make it through.

640
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,180
- Stop.
- No way.

641
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:54,389
- Brake.
- I can't.

642
00:34:55,601 --> 00:34:57,601
- Brake.
- Stop.

643
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,105
Manual control's
been restored.

644
00:35:17,205 --> 00:35:21,305
Continue straight
until you reach Pier 15.

645
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:29,780
Enter the wrecking yard.

646
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,161
Proceed to the
end of the dock.

647
00:35:31,261 --> 00:35:35,261
We will eliminate all
obstacles for you.

648
00:35:42,728 --> 00:35:44,728
Watch. Watch. Watch.

649
00:36:14,675 --> 00:36:17,275
- Stay your course.
- Turn.

650
00:36:18,262 --> 00:36:20,662
- Turn.
- Turn right now.

651
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:39,614
Holy...

652
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:53,252
Oh, God.

653
00:36:53,754 --> 00:36:55,754
Oh, my God.

654
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,202
- Grab the seat.
- I can't.

655
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:04,302
- Grab the seat. The seat.
- No, I can't.

656
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:06,806
No.

657
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,491
The crane will
release the car.

658
00:37:19,591 --> 00:37:21,439
If you do not jump,
you will drown.

659
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:24,741
- We have to jump.
- No. No way.

660
00:37:24,866 --> 00:37:27,666
We have to. When I say 'go.'

661
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,373
Ready?

662
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,835
Go. Jump.

663
00:37:54,102 --> 00:37:57,802
I want both the
divers in that water.

664
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:02,136
- Let's go. Move.
- Let's go, let's go.

665
00:38:02,236 --> 00:38:04,236
Move, move, move.

666
00:38:20,753 --> 00:38:23,753
- Yeah, I already
called it in.

667
00:38:23,784 --> 00:38:25,658
Wait till it clears.

668
00:38:25,758 --> 00:38:27,284
Thirty feet back, that's it.

669
00:38:27,384 --> 00:38:28,827
Yeah, I know,
the Army sent a Black Hawk,

670
00:38:28,927 --> 00:38:30,287
so I'll be there in
a couple of hours.

671
00:38:30,387 --> 00:38:31,284
What do you mean,

672
00:38:31,384 --> 00:38:33,340
the car is not
registered to anyone?

673
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,291
Check the VIN number again.

674
00:38:35,391 --> 00:38:37,605
Leave your message for Sam,

675
00:38:37,705 --> 00:38:40,421
even though I know
it's you, Mom.

676
00:38:40,521 --> 00:38:43,224
Sam? Baby, listen to me.

677
00:38:43,324 --> 00:38:44,564
You need to call me...

678
00:38:44,664 --> 00:38:46,843
as soon as you get
this message, okay?

679
00:38:46,943 --> 00:38:50,656
Baby, please. I love you.

680
00:38:52,617 --> 00:38:54,359
- What about the girl?
- What?

681
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:56,019
What about the girl?

682
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:57,176
Well, the Department
of Transpo...

683
00:38:57,276 --> 00:38:58,072
tells me that there was...

684
00:38:58,172 --> 00:38:59,669
a seven-minute
equipment failure...

685
00:38:59,769 --> 00:39:00,691
on their traffic cams.

686
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:01,789
- We didn't get
a picture of her.

687
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:02,442
Don't tell me that.

688
00:39:02,542 --> 00:39:05,375
- That's what
they're telling me.

689
00:39:05,475 --> 00:39:07,697
I need an ID on that girl.

690
00:39:07,797 --> 00:39:11,409
Do you think they
could derail a train?

691
00:39:11,509 --> 00:39:12,937
They changed every
traffic light...

692
00:39:13,037 --> 00:39:13,620
to get us here.

693
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,538
The woman, she called me
on a stranger's cell phone...

694
00:39:15,638 --> 00:39:16,832
who happened to be
sitting next to me.

695
00:39:16,932 --> 00:39:17,832
Never met the guy in my life.

696
00:39:17,932 --> 00:39:18,980
You know, and then
they broke me out...

697
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:19,875
of maximum security custody...

698
00:39:19,975 --> 00:39:21,171
in a way I'm not even
gonna describe...

699
00:39:21,271 --> 00:39:22,211
to you because
it sounds crazy,

700
00:39:22,311 --> 00:39:24,006
and then they lift us
off the face of...

701
00:39:24,106 --> 00:39:25,889
the Earth and drop us
into this shit pile?

702
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:27,224
She could probably
derail a train.

703
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:28,492
She could probably
turn a train...

704
00:39:28,592 --> 00:39:29,259
into a talking duck.

705
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,182
And what about these
goddamn ghost...

706
00:39:31,282 --> 00:39:33,054
cranes that keep
helping peewee out?

707
00:39:33,154 --> 00:39:34,575
I mean, they don't
just lift cars...

708
00:39:34,675 --> 00:39:36,015
up in the air all
by themselves...

709
00:39:36,115 --> 00:39:38,727
like a giant pair
of chopsticks.

710
00:39:38,827 --> 00:39:40,345
I want to know how
these things run,

711
00:39:40,445 --> 00:39:41,396
how they're programmed.

712
00:39:41,496 --> 00:39:43,315
What'd you say your name was?

713
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:45,515
- Rachel.
- I'm Jerry.

714
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:53,781
- Hello?

715
00:39:53,881 --> 00:39:55,917
The barge will dock
in 14 minutes.

716
00:39:56,017 --> 00:39:58,594
Leave the boatyard
with the female.

717
00:39:58,694 --> 00:40:00,296
Take Highway 123 East.

718
00:40:00,396 --> 00:40:02,975
Walk to mile marker 108.

719
00:40:03,642 --> 00:40:08,542
- What? Was it her?
- She called you 'the female.'

720
00:40:08,855 --> 00:40:11,050
Have Mortuary Affairs
freeze everything...

721
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,383
belonging to Ethan Shaw.

722
00:40:12,483 --> 00:40:14,685
- No personal effects
to next of kin.

723
00:40:14,785 --> 00:40:15,769
You, Due Process.

724
00:40:15,869 --> 00:40:16,119
- Bye.

725
00:40:16,219 --> 00:40:17,721
What do you have
on Ethan Shaw?

726
00:40:17,821 --> 00:40:20,515
I have a name.
It's Agent Perez.

727
00:40:20,615 --> 00:40:22,818
And I'll answer that question
when I get back from D.C.

728
00:40:22,918 --> 00:40:24,838
- Wait a minute.
What's in D.C. ?

729
00:40:24,938 --> 00:40:26,320
Shaw's private quarters.

730
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,906
I need you to stay here.

731
00:40:28,006 --> 00:40:30,325
I'm not losing my
link to Ethan Shaw.

732
00:40:30,425 --> 00:40:32,453
Maybe I haven't
made this clear.

733
00:40:32,553 --> 00:40:35,538
I don't work for you.
I work for the Air Force.

734
00:40:35,638 --> 00:40:39,738
Keep your phone on,
I'll keep you updated.

735
00:40:43,929 --> 00:40:46,210
If you're staring at
me, it better be...

736
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,124
because I'm the
goddamn suspect.

737
00:40:48,224 --> 00:40:50,031
Because if I don't
get some good leads...

738
00:40:50,131 --> 00:40:51,712
soon, you're all
gonna be demoted...

739
00:40:51,812 --> 00:40:53,803
into something that's
gonna require...

740
00:40:53,903 --> 00:40:55,465
touching shit with your hands.

741
00:40:55,565 --> 00:40:59,565
Now, let's get going.
We got work to do.

742
00:41:05,949 --> 00:41:09,561
Hexamethylene.
Our latest chemical explosive.

743
00:41:09,661 --> 00:41:12,011
One single tiny crystal,

744
00:41:12,111 --> 00:41:15,163
80 times more
powerful than C4.

745
00:41:15,263 --> 00:41:17,563
Odorless, undetectable.

746
00:41:17,595 --> 00:41:19,077
And best of all, it can be...

747
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:21,240
cut down in size for
stealth operations.

748
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,242
This valve is a sonic trigger.

749
00:41:23,342 --> 00:41:25,618
The sound frequency
triggers the explosion.

750
00:41:25,718 --> 00:41:27,912
Each trigger is programmed
to have a unique...

751
00:41:28,012 --> 00:41:30,665
frequency specific
only to one Hex crystal.

752
00:41:30,765 --> 00:41:34,565
That frequency triggers
the explosion.

753
00:41:38,105 --> 00:41:39,881
Yeah.

754
00:41:39,981 --> 00:41:41,580
We recently received approval...

755
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,228
to begin shipping
to the field.

756
00:41:43,328 --> 00:41:47,328
Two hundred units
are shipping out today.

757
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:09,035
- Sign right here.
- Yeah.

758
00:42:09,135 --> 00:42:11,135
Thank you.

759
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:15,597
The package you've
just received...

760
00:42:15,697 --> 00:42:17,208
contains a small metal valve.

761
00:42:17,308 --> 00:42:19,308
Open the package.

762
00:42:22,522 --> 00:42:24,090
- Okay.
- Remove the valve...

763
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:27,990
and follow our
instructions precisely.

764
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:38,228
- You've received the package.
- Yes, ma'am, it just arrived.

765
00:42:38,328 --> 00:42:40,648
- What kind of stone is this?
- No questions.

766
00:42:40,748 --> 00:42:42,316
Cut the stone and
place the setting...

767
00:42:42,416 --> 00:42:45,544
according to the
specifications...

768
00:42:45,644 --> 00:42:47,644
we sent you.

769
00:43:28,376 --> 00:43:30,611
I'd just dropped my
son off at the train.

770
00:43:30,711 --> 00:43:32,136
I was out having
drinks with my...

771
00:43:32,236 --> 00:43:33,531
girlfriends when
the call came.

772
00:43:33,631 --> 00:43:34,525
- What about you?

773
00:43:34,625 --> 00:43:36,574
The first call came
to my apartment.

774
00:43:36,674 --> 00:43:39,174
- After the boxes?
- Yeah.

775
00:43:40,053 --> 00:43:41,410
Well, then this whole thing's...

776
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:43,131
obviously gotta be
about your brother.

777
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,270
- Really, it's
that obvious, huh?

778
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:45,343
I mean, you got
all this stuff.

779
00:43:45,443 --> 00:43:46,960
The weapons, the cash,
the airplane manuals.

780
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,128
- Okay.
- He was your twin.

781
00:43:48,228 --> 00:43:49,057
- They sent it to
the wrong brother.

782
00:43:49,157 --> 00:43:49,254
Right.

783
00:43:49,354 --> 00:43:50,514
So you're implying
my brother's a terrorist.

784
00:43:50,614 --> 00:43:54,514
I'm implying, if not
him, then why you?

785
00:43:58,278 --> 00:44:00,057
I'm sorry. I know he
just died. I'm not...

786
00:44:00,157 --> 00:44:01,849
trying to insult his
memory or anything.

787
00:44:01,949 --> 00:44:03,993
No, he hasn't been
dead long enough...

788
00:44:04,093 --> 00:44:05,311
to be a memory, Rachel.

789
00:44:05,411 --> 00:44:06,010
If you knew my brother,

790
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,020
you'd laugh all
day at the idea...

791
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,117
that he was a
terrorist or a spy...

792
00:44:08,217 --> 00:44:09,155
or whatever else
you're saying...

793
00:44:09,255 --> 00:44:10,366
- How do you know?
- Because he's my brother.

794
00:44:10,466 --> 00:44:11,208
That's something
you would know...

795
00:44:11,308 --> 00:44:11,701
about your brother.

796
00:44:11,801 --> 00:44:16,201
Well, when's the last time
you talked to him?

797
00:44:19,507 --> 00:44:21,746
I don't need this.
Hey, listen. Hey.

798
00:44:21,846 --> 00:44:24,212
I don't have to
explain myself to you.

799
00:44:24,312 --> 00:44:26,164
- Is your son a terrorist?
- Yeah, my son's a terrorist.

800
00:44:26,264 --> 00:44:27,283
Yeah, well, he's
just as likely...

801
00:44:27,383 --> 00:44:28,340
to be a terrorist
as my brother.

802
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,881
And let's not forget
you in all this. Why...

803
00:44:29,981 --> 00:44:31,084
are you here? What's
your day job?

804
00:44:31,184 --> 00:44:32,943
- I know it isn't
manual shift driver.

805
00:44:33,043 --> 00:44:33,754
I'm a paralegal.

806
00:44:33,854 --> 00:44:34,498
- I don't have a
connection to anything.

807
00:44:34,598 --> 00:44:34,722
Paralegal?

808
00:44:34,822 --> 00:44:34,986
- I don't have a
connection to anything.

809
00:44:35,086 --> 00:44:35,089
Paralegal?

810
00:44:35,189 --> 00:44:36,473
How do I know you're
not lying to me?

811
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:37,424
What does a paralegal do?

812
00:44:37,524 --> 00:44:39,343
The same thing as the guys
with their names on the door,

813
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:41,427
except I do it
for $11 an hour,

814
00:44:41,527 --> 00:44:42,855
so they can bill 200.

815
00:44:42,955 --> 00:44:44,348
That nail it for
you, Sherlock?

816
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:45,974
That still doesn't explain why
we're walking out here...

817
00:44:46,074 --> 00:44:50,270
- I don't know why
the hell I'm out here.

818
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:52,370
Yeah, I know...

819
00:44:55,666 --> 00:44:57,666
Hey.

820
00:44:58,209 --> 00:45:00,446
- Are you Jerry Shaw?
- Who are you?

821
00:45:00,546 --> 00:45:01,748
- Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

822
00:45:01,848 --> 00:45:02,949
I sent the package
like she asked.

823
00:45:03,049 --> 00:45:04,367
- Wait, what package?
- What is that?

824
00:45:04,467 --> 00:45:05,342
- Now she wants
me to drive you?

825
00:45:05,442 --> 00:45:05,710
Who, 'she'?

826
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:07,203
- I won't. I'm done.
- You know 'she'?

827
00:45:07,303 --> 00:45:08,370
- Wait.
- Stay right there.

828
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:09,921
- Get back.
- Here. Here's the address.

829
00:45:10,021 --> 00:45:12,924
- Why are you attack...
- Here. Here are the keys.

830
00:45:13,024 --> 00:45:14,000
Take the goddamn van.

831
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,085
- You think I'm going to...
- Who's doing this?

832
00:45:15,185 --> 00:45:16,757
...do this because
I'm Iranian?

833
00:45:16,857 --> 00:45:18,796
I am American. I'm
finished. I'm done.

834
00:45:18,896 --> 00:45:20,703
- What? What are
you talking about?

835
00:45:20,803 --> 00:45:21,390
You take it.

836
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:22,301
- What are you talking about?

837
00:45:22,401 --> 00:45:23,300
I won't do this
because I can't.

838
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:23,788
- Hello?

839
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:25,428
Stop him now, or he will die.

840
00:45:25,528 --> 00:45:27,097
Listen to me,
what are you talking about?

841
00:45:27,197 --> 00:45:28,139
- You try to do
this without me.

842
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:29,181
How are you seeing
us right now?

843
00:45:29,281 --> 00:45:31,442
- Stop him now.
- What is she saying?

844
00:45:31,542 --> 00:45:33,903
Stop. Hey. You gotta stop.

845
00:45:34,003 --> 00:45:36,830
- Wait.
- You gotta stop.

846
00:46:10,194 --> 00:46:13,223
- You killed that man.
- Desertion is not an option.

847
00:46:13,323 --> 00:46:14,096
Take the van.

848
00:46:14,196 --> 00:46:16,110
Drive to
Indianapolis, Indiana.

849
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:18,160
72 West 56th Street.

850
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:21,360
Arrive no later
than 11:00 a.m.

851
00:46:33,133 --> 00:46:35,994
- Welcome.
- Hello. Agent Perez.

852
00:46:36,094 --> 00:46:38,413
- To the right?
- Yes, ma'am.

853
00:46:38,513 --> 00:46:40,206
- ID, ma'am.
- OSI.

854
00:46:40,306 --> 00:46:41,617
I ordered a freeze
on Ethan Shaw's...

855
00:46:41,717 --> 00:46:42,917
personal effects.
What's going on?

856
00:46:43,017 --> 00:46:44,753
Orders to sanitize came down
from the Two Star.

857
00:46:44,853 --> 00:46:46,630
Okay, I'm countermanding.
Thank you. I'll take that.

858
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:47,881
- Tell your guys to clear out.
- Who are you?

859
00:46:47,981 --> 00:46:49,590
This scene's part of
a federal investigation...

860
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:51,111
with national security
ramifications.

861
00:46:51,211 --> 00:46:51,717
This your log?

862
00:46:51,817 --> 00:46:52,253
- Yes, it is.

863
00:46:52,353 --> 00:46:53,386
Okay, my name is Agent Perez.

864
00:46:53,486 --> 00:46:54,470
You can take this up
with your superiors.

865
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:55,688
- Clear the room.
- You guys move out.

866
00:46:55,788 --> 00:46:57,932
No gloves?
Get statements from everybody.

867
00:46:58,032 --> 00:46:58,323
- Yes, ma'am.

868
00:46:58,423 --> 00:46:59,265
And find out who
this Two Star is.

869
00:46:59,365 --> 00:47:01,765
I mean, come on, really.

870
00:47:17,216 --> 00:47:19,916
Sir. We have a positive ID.

871
00:47:30,437 --> 00:47:32,437
Okay.

872
00:47:32,898 --> 00:47:35,509
The skin was pretty fried,
but we still managed to get...

873
00:47:35,609 --> 00:47:39,595
a partial print that matches
to a Ranim Khalid.

874
00:47:39,695 --> 00:47:41,968
He's a United States
citizen, registered

875
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:44,225
Republican, and he
owns a music store.

876
00:47:44,325 --> 00:47:46,803
- The guy's cleaner
than Ivory Snow.

877
00:47:46,903 --> 00:47:48,187
Got something here.

878
00:47:48,287 --> 00:47:50,364
- That's a bone mic.
- Hello.

879
00:47:50,464 --> 00:47:52,942
Military grade.
He didn't get that on eBay.

880
00:47:53,042 --> 00:47:55,742
Someone was talking to him.

881
00:48:26,448 --> 00:48:28,110
We have a
cyber-terrorist here.

882
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:30,351
Someone's already inside
our computer systems,

883
00:48:30,451 --> 00:48:32,669
hacking into the power grid,

884
00:48:32,769 --> 00:48:35,231
traffic cams,
automated cranes.

885
00:48:35,331 --> 00:48:40,331
There's no way the boy
and the girl did this alone.

886
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,607
- Agent Zoe Perez?
- Yes.

887
00:49:11,707 --> 00:49:12,751
United States Air Force

888
00:49:12,851 --> 00:49:14,561
Security Forces.
Please come with us.

889
00:49:14,661 --> 00:49:18,361
- What's this about?
- Get in the car.

890
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:19,675
Violence has broken out...

891
00:49:19,775 --> 00:49:21,399
in the Middle East as
militants accuse...

892
00:49:21,499 --> 00:49:22,277
the United States...

893
00:49:22,377 --> 00:49:23,693
of launching
American missiles...

894
00:49:23,793 --> 00:49:26,174
to demolish a village
in Baluchistan,

895
00:49:26,274 --> 00:49:27,998
killing innocent civilians.

896
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:29,458
The attack has triggered a...

897
00:49:29,558 --> 00:49:31,501
series of retaliatory
suicide bombings...

898
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:33,870
against American
embassies abroad.

899
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:36,504
Early reports indicate
the American...

900
00:49:36,604 --> 00:49:38,458
death toll now stands at 56,

901
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:40,265
with threats of
further violence...

902
00:49:40,365 --> 00:49:40,968
here at home.

903
00:49:41,068 --> 00:49:43,068
Officials...

904
00:49:48,275 --> 00:49:51,302
What's he doing on
a train, your kid?

905
00:49:51,402 --> 00:49:53,646
He goes to a music magnet.

906
00:49:53,746 --> 00:49:55,351
His school's on a
tour of Washington.

907
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:57,101
They're playing at
the Kennedy Center.

908
00:49:57,201 --> 00:50:00,912
Wow. That's big.
And you just...

909
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:06,442
Well, why'd you make
that noise, 'Huh'?

910
00:50:06,542 --> 00:50:08,942
I can't make noises now?

911
00:50:09,337 --> 00:50:10,321
- You think I
should have gone.

912
00:50:10,421 --> 00:50:11,538
He's playing at
the Kennedy Center.

913
00:50:11,638 --> 00:50:13,156
- That's kind of a big deal.
- It is a big deal.

914
00:50:13,256 --> 00:50:14,164
So I think maybe one parent...

915
00:50:14,264 --> 00:50:15,492
should have gone,
that's all I'm saying.

916
00:50:15,592 --> 00:50:17,169
Well, one parent had to work
while the other one does...

917
00:50:17,269 --> 00:50:20,998
everything humanly possible
to bail on child support.

918
00:50:21,098 --> 00:50:25,752
But I don't expect you to know
a thing about responsibility.

919
00:50:25,852 --> 00:50:26,795
You know, Rachel,
you don't know...

920
00:50:26,895 --> 00:50:27,554
the first thing about me.

921
00:50:27,654 --> 00:50:29,214
I know your brother just died,
and whatever he was into...

922
00:50:29,314 --> 00:50:30,205
- put my son's life at risk.

923
00:50:30,305 --> 00:50:31,465
I don't wanna talk
about my brother.

924
00:50:31,565 --> 00:50:34,051
- Okay? I'm not kidding.
- I'm not kidding, either.

925
00:50:34,151 --> 00:50:36,751
Jesus, look what happened.

926
00:50:37,029 --> 00:50:38,764
Can you honestly say he had
nothing to do with this?

927
00:50:38,864 --> 00:50:40,197
I'm asking you not
to talk about him.

928
00:50:40,297 --> 00:50:40,733
Respect that.

929
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:41,674
I'm asking you to be honest...

930
00:50:41,774 --> 00:50:42,734
with yourself. Your
brother's a...

931
00:50:42,834 --> 00:50:45,643
I'm asking you to be honest...

932
00:50:45,743 --> 00:50:49,143
with yourself. Your
brother's a...

933
00:51:03,637 --> 00:51:09,518
Hey. You can't just walk away.
You can't just leave.

934
00:51:10,061 --> 00:51:10,464
- Yes, I can.

935
00:51:10,564 --> 00:51:11,629
Now we have 15
minutes to get...

936
00:51:11,729 --> 00:51:16,158
- wherever the hell
we're going, all right?

937
00:51:16,258 --> 00:51:18,258
Yeah.

938
00:51:23,823 --> 00:51:25,823
I need you.

939
00:51:29,746 --> 00:51:31,746
I could've gone.

940
00:51:35,419 --> 00:51:37,419
I should have.

941
00:52:03,861 --> 00:52:07,411
You are two minutes
behind schedule.

942
00:52:07,511 --> 00:52:11,111
Go to the alley
behind the building.

943
00:52:11,535 --> 00:52:13,646
- Go to the armored truck.

944
00:52:13,746 --> 00:52:16,106
I don't see an armored truck.

945
00:52:16,206 --> 00:52:18,206
There it is.

946
00:52:23,046 --> 00:52:24,887
In 20 seconds, men will exit...

947
00:52:24,987 --> 00:52:26,950
the elevator. They
will be armed.

948
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:28,618
One will be carrying
a briefcase.

949
00:52:28,718 --> 00:52:30,870
Retrieve it from him,
then return to the van.

950
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:32,028
- This is insane.
I'm not doing this.

951
00:52:32,128 --> 00:52:32,797
You want us to rob them?

952
00:52:32,897 --> 00:52:35,297
You now have 15 seconds.

953
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:40,759
Security. What's
your emergency?

954
00:52:44,524 --> 00:52:49,124
What are you doing?
I'm not robbing them. Shit.

955
00:53:00,415 --> 00:53:01,608
Put your gun on the floor.

956
00:53:01,708 --> 00:53:03,775
Put your gun on the
floor. Look straight.

957
00:53:03,875 --> 00:53:04,912
You want me to
blow his head off?

958
00:53:05,012 --> 00:53:05,819
Put the gun on the ground.

959
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:07,571
We don't wanna hurt you guys.
Just drop the case.

960
00:53:07,671 --> 00:53:08,989
Drop the case and
kick it to her.

961
00:53:09,089 --> 00:53:10,371
Yeah, well, you're
bringing a shit storm...

962
00:53:10,471 --> 00:53:10,824
on your head.

963
00:53:10,924 --> 00:53:12,170
Yeah, we're already
in mid shit storm.

964
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:12,834
Now kick the case.

965
00:53:12,934 --> 00:53:14,934
Okay. Easy.

966
00:53:15,887 --> 00:53:17,789
- Look straight.
- Okay, done.

967
00:53:17,889 --> 00:53:19,889
Kick it.

968
00:53:23,269 --> 00:53:24,253
Okay.

969
00:53:24,353 --> 00:53:25,963
- Don't even think about it.
- Back up.

970
00:53:26,063 --> 00:53:28,063
Easy.

971
00:53:29,734 --> 00:53:30,927
Back up.

972
00:53:31,027 --> 00:53:32,213
Walk over here,
stand next to him,

973
00:53:32,313 --> 00:53:32,844
and turn around.

974
00:53:32,944 --> 00:53:36,640
- Stand over here.
- Just take it easy.

975
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:40,578
Turn around. Turn
around. Turn around.

976
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:55,263
Let's move, let's move.

977
00:53:58,677 --> 00:54:00,677
Come on.

978
00:54:14,525 --> 00:54:16,525
Jerry. Here.

979
00:54:18,821 --> 00:54:20,821
Move, move.

980
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:25,159
Freeze. Police.

981
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,447
Drop the gun. Drop the gun.

982
00:54:27,547 --> 00:54:28,815
We're security. We
just got robbed.

983
00:54:28,915 --> 00:54:32,815
And there they are.
We just got robbed.

984
00:54:34,961 --> 00:54:37,461
Move. Get out of the way.

985
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:39,839
Move.

986
00:54:43,804 --> 00:54:46,130
Get out of the way.
Out of the way.

987
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:48,230
Move.

988
00:54:48,849 --> 00:54:51,794
- Hey, watch it, lady.
- Jerry, run.

989
00:54:51,894 --> 00:54:53,894
This way.

990
00:54:56,107 --> 00:54:57,717
- Out of the way.
- Come on.

991
00:54:57,817 --> 00:55:00,717
- Move out of the way.
- Move.

992
00:55:01,862 --> 00:55:04,162
You see that? This way.

993
00:55:17,168 --> 00:55:19,968
- You are Jerry Shaw?
- Yeah.

994
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:23,299
Please come. Please.

995
00:55:23,425 --> 00:55:26,325
- Thank you.
- Please come in.

996
00:55:28,887 --> 00:55:30,887
Hi.

997
00:55:45,111 --> 00:55:47,847
- Wait. What is that?
- It's a timer.

998
00:55:47,947 --> 00:55:49,724
- For what?
- I don't know.

999
00:55:49,824 --> 00:55:50,996
The only things I can think of...

1000
00:55:51,096 --> 00:55:52,268
with timers are
microwaves and...

1001
00:55:52,368 --> 00:55:55,395
And bombs.
You were gonna say bombs.

1002
00:55:55,495 --> 00:55:57,174
- Coffeemakers have timers.

1003
00:55:57,274 --> 00:55:59,274
Yeah, Jerry, it's
a coffeemaker.

1004
00:55:59,374 --> 00:56:01,374
That's great.

1005
00:56:23,731 --> 00:56:25,632
We've mobilized every asset
we can get our hands on.

1006
00:56:25,732 --> 00:56:27,559
So 12 more confirmed dead?

1007
00:56:27,659 --> 00:56:29,659
Yes, sir.

1008
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:32,640
I want hourly sit reps
from General McKenna.

1009
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:35,600
There's a military base
37 miles from that port.

1010
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:36,977
Scramble whatever you can.

1011
00:56:37,077 --> 00:56:39,677
- Yes, sir.
- Come with me.

1012
00:56:41,748 --> 00:56:42,489
Begging your pardon, sir,

1013
00:56:42,589 --> 00:56:43,867
but if you're thinking
of taking me off...

1014
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:45,404
- the Shaw
investigation, I'd...

1015
00:56:45,504 --> 00:56:46,151
Taking you off?

1016
00:56:46,251 --> 00:56:51,651
Agent, for the first time
you're being brought onboard.

1017
00:56:55,426 --> 00:56:59,426
Back to bus 30 minutes. Okay?
30 minutes.

1018
00:57:04,312 --> 00:57:06,291
We're convinced a
terrorist attack...

1019
00:57:06,391 --> 00:57:07,931
on American soil is imminent.

1020
00:57:08,031 --> 00:57:10,455
Over the past two
days, we've received...

1021
00:57:10,555 --> 00:57:12,135
over 200 terrorist threats.

1022
00:57:12,235 --> 00:57:16,013
All starting the day
that Ethan Shaw died.

1023
00:57:16,113 --> 00:57:21,285
An accident. Or not.
You're gonna help us find out.

1024
00:57:23,997 --> 00:57:26,797
- Mr. Secretary.
- Gentlemen.

1025
00:57:38,884 --> 00:57:40,945
- I didn't think that
there was a 36th floor.

1026
00:57:41,045 --> 00:57:43,184
Glad we can still
keep some secrets.

1027
00:57:53,482 --> 00:57:54,506
I want to know
what's in the case.

1028
00:57:54,606 --> 00:57:54,967
Is it a bomb?

1029
00:57:55,067 --> 00:57:57,602
Go to Macy's.
Customer Service Department.

1030
00:57:57,702 --> 00:57:59,438
Two Visa gift cards
will be waiting.

1031
00:57:59,538 --> 00:58:01,481
You have 25 minutes
to purchase new clothes,

1032
00:58:01,581 --> 00:58:03,942
and then re-board the bus
for your next destination.

1033
00:58:04,042 --> 00:58:07,792
I'm done taking orders
over the phone,

1034
00:58:07,892 --> 00:58:09,892
you understand?

1035
00:58:12,459 --> 00:58:13,801
Well, that was quick.
You done playing...

1036
00:58:13,901 --> 00:58:14,903
this hide-and-go-seek
bullshit?

1037
00:58:15,003 --> 00:58:16,787
We are not hiding, Jerry.

1038
00:58:16,887 --> 00:58:18,718
To your left is
a Circuit City.

1039
00:58:18,818 --> 00:58:20,407
Second floor, north corner.

1040
00:58:20,507 --> 00:58:23,146
Go inside. Find
the Home Theater

1041
00:58:23,246 --> 00:58:25,129
Center. We are waiting.

1042
00:58:25,229 --> 00:58:28,348
Second floor. She's here.

1043
00:58:36,272 --> 00:58:38,317
- Sir.
- Major.

1044
00:58:38,692 --> 00:58:41,261
- Major William Bowman.
- Agent Zoe Perez.

1045
00:58:41,361 --> 00:58:42,771
Welcome to Eagle Eye.

1046
00:58:42,871 --> 00:58:44,850
Looking to upgrade
your home theater?

1047
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:47,149
Circuit City has the
largest selection...

1048
00:58:47,249 --> 00:58:50,649
of advanced TVs
and home theater...

1049
00:58:50,649 --> 00:58:54,149
systems. Visit our
TV department...

1050
00:58:58,292 --> 00:58:59,630
- Hi, welcome to
Circuit City. I'm Billy.

1051
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:00,662
We just need some time alone.

1052
00:59:00,762 --> 00:59:01,368
- We're having a sale...

1053
00:59:01,468 --> 00:59:02,321
Okay, Billy, I'll
find you later.

1054
00:59:02,421 --> 00:59:04,421
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

1055
00:59:05,883 --> 00:59:07,409
Okay.

1056
00:59:07,509 --> 00:59:10,309
Okay, here it is. All right?

1057
00:59:11,304 --> 00:59:13,304
I'm done.

1058
00:59:13,431 --> 00:59:15,050
- Hello?
- Mr. Shaw,

1059
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:16,597
this is Miss Beck from

1060
00:59:16,697 --> 00:59:18,961
Midwest Cellular
regarding your...

1061
00:59:19,061 --> 00:59:20,337
What is this?

1062
00:59:20,437 --> 00:59:23,961
- This is you. This
is Jerry Shaw.

1063
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:24,523
What?

1064
00:59:24,623 --> 00:59:25,936
A series of purchases,

1065
00:59:26,036 --> 00:59:27,969
preferences, and
quantifiable...

1066
00:59:28,069 --> 00:59:32,669
data points that we define
as your personality.

1067
00:59:34,826 --> 00:59:37,375
We monitor every
social network.

1068
00:59:37,475 --> 00:59:38,562
Internet logs,

1069
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:41,262
instant and text messages,

1070
00:59:41,289 --> 00:59:44,484
known associates,
your friends, companions.

1071
00:59:44,584 --> 00:59:45,536
Jerry.

1072
00:59:45,636 --> 00:59:48,946
E- mails received and sent.
Cell phone usage.

1073
00:59:49,046 --> 00:59:50,330
- What happened
to Red Lobster?

1074
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:51,240
We utilize security,

1075
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:54,173
surveillance and
traffic cameras...

1076
00:59:54,273 --> 00:59:55,953
to analyze movements.

1077
00:59:56,053 --> 00:59:58,859
We use this data
to form personality profiles.

1078
00:59:58,959 --> 01:00:02,459
Yeah, I'm calling
actually about...

1079
01:00:02,892 --> 01:00:04,377
We know who you are.

1080
01:00:04,477 --> 01:00:05,962
... at least 30 minutes late.

1081
01:00:06,062 --> 01:00:07,722
Sam doesn't care.

1082
01:00:07,822 --> 01:00:09,140
We are everywhere.

1083
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,550
What do you mean?
Why do you keep saying 'we'?

1084
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:14,011
We the people of
the United States...

1085
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:16,013
And so, my fellow Americans...

1086
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:20,099
... in order to form
a more perfect union,

1087
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:22,199
establish justice,

1088
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:24,383
insure domestic tranquility,

1089
01:00:24,483 --> 01:00:26,698
provide for the
common defense...

1090
01:00:26,798 --> 01:00:28,190
All programmed options...

1091
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:29,512
- Programmed options?
- ... sector searches,

1092
01:00:29,612 --> 01:00:32,351
and downloaded points of data...

1093
01:00:32,451 --> 01:00:35,364
will lead to this
central command.

1094
01:00:35,464 --> 01:00:37,464
You're a computer.

1095
01:00:37,923 --> 01:00:40,117
Say hello to our
Autonomous Reconnaissance

1096

She crunches all
our raw intel,

1099
01:00:52,479 --> 01:00:53,555
finds patterns,

1100
01:00:53,655 --> 01:00:55,891
helps predict the movement
of possible suspects,

1101
01:00:55,991 --> 01:00:59,441
right down to
behavior, motivation,

1102
01:00:59,541 --> 01:01:01,541
even personality.

1103

- in her investigation
of Ethan Shaw.

1109
01:01:17,917 --> 01:01:19,528
Yes, Mr. Secretary.

1110
01:01:19,628 --> 01:01:22,203
Hello, Agent
Perez. Perez, Zoe.

01:01:34,433 --> 01:01:37,470
valid threat at Los Angeles
International Airport.

1117
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:40,297
Alerting airport authorities
and local police.

1118
01:01:40,397 --> 01:01:42,975
Those gold spheres send her
infrared data,

1119
01:01:43,075 --> 01:01:46,262
any communication intercepts
that she flags a threat.

1120
01:01:46,362 --> 01:01:51,662
She analyzes it and tells us
what to pay attention to.

1121
01:01:52,199 --> 01:01:54,076
Dispatch to
Terrorism Task Force.

1122
01:01:54,176 --> 01:01:54,944
Threat at LAX.

1123
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:56,979
We're still beta-testing,

1124
01:01:57,079 --> 01:02:01,179
but I'm pushing to
get her online sooner.

1125
01:02:04,627 --> 01:02:09,256
Mr. Secretary? A call for you.

1126
01:02:10,215 --> 01:02:12,743
- Try to keep up.
- Yes, sir.

1127
01:02:12,843 --> 01:02:15,129
And find out about Shaw.

1128
01:02:15,229 --> 01:02:17,229
- Major.
- Sir?

1129
01:02:23,019 --> 01:02:24,959
Your profile reveals
a pathological...

1130
01:02:25,059 --> 01:02:26,214
aversion to conformity,

1131
01:02:26,314 --> 01:02:29,414
education, career,
even voting.

1132
01:02:29,607 --> 01:02:31,801
Therefore, we conclude
that extreme coercion...

1133
01:02:31,901 --> 01:02:33,521
is necessary to motivate you.

1134
01:02:33,621 --> 01:02:36,481
Unlike your brother Ethan,
who was self-motivated.

1135
01:02:36,581 --> 01:02:38,641
How do you know my brother?
He worked in a press office.

1136
01:02:38,741 --> 01:02:41,352
His employment
there was a cover.

1137
01:02:41,452 --> 01:02:44,120
Everyone in count
erintelligence...

1138
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:45,689
operations has one.

1139
01:02:45,789 --> 01:02:48,374
Ethan was a Minuteman,
just like me.

1140
01:02:48,474 --> 01:02:50,035
Army, Navy, Air Force.

1141
01:02:50,135 --> 01:02:51,416
Every branch of
the military had...

1142
01:02:51,516 --> 01:02:52,454
a Minuteman posted here...

1143
01:02:52,554 --> 01:02:55,156
for a 12-hour shift,
just in case she...

1144
01:02:55,256 --> 01:02:57,659
flags a threat, and
monitor hardware.

1145
01:02:57,759 --> 01:03:01,263
The night Ethan died,
he left this post...

1146
01:03:01,363 --> 01:03:03,005
three minutes early.

1147
01:03:03,105 --> 01:03:06,099
Now, you don't do that. Ever.

1148
01:03:06,642 --> 01:03:09,719
You are both required
to complete a task.

1149
01:03:09,819 --> 01:03:10,169
- What?

1150
01:03:10,269 --> 01:03:12,505
The protection of our
national security.

1151
01:03:12,605 --> 01:03:14,218
The Constitution allows
for civilians...

1152
01:03:14,318 --> 01:03:15,016
to be recruited...

1153
01:03:15,116 --> 01:03:16,467
- for the national defense.
- I'm done.

1154
01:03:16,567 --> 01:03:18,635
I'm done. You don't know me.
You don't know my brother.

1155
01:03:18,735 --> 01:03:20,271
This is bullshit.
I'm not serving...

1156
01:03:20,371 --> 01:03:21,730
in the goddamn
national defense.

1157
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:25,630
We know all about
him, Jerry. And you.

1158
01:03:26,076 --> 01:03:29,353
Before he was a year old,
Ethan walked.

1159
01:03:29,453 --> 01:03:34,053
The same task took you
18 months to accomplish.

1160
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:36,035
- How did you get this?
- Look at Ethan.

1161
01:03:36,135 --> 01:03:38,529
They were uploaded
from his home computer.

1162
01:03:38,629 --> 01:03:40,006
You want to come
over here, sweetie?

1163
01:03:40,106 --> 01:03:41,206
Come on over here with Ethan.

1164
01:03:41,306 --> 01:03:43,037
- Jerry. Birthday
cake. Let's go.

1165
01:03:43,137 --> 01:03:43,950
Ethan had these?

1166
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:45,335
Come on, let's blow
out the candles.

1167
01:03:45,435 --> 01:03:47,212
Just for a little bit.

1168
01:03:47,312 --> 01:03:49,419
Although you're
identical in appearance,

1169
01:03:49,519 --> 01:03:51,465
you lack the motivation
and talent...

1170
01:03:51,565 --> 01:03:53,792
- that enabled Ethan to excel.
- ... Jerry, come on.

1171
01:03:53,892 --> 01:03:55,594
- Stop it.
- Do it like Ethan did.

1172
01:03:55,694 --> 01:03:59,589
You're different from Ethan
in every way, except one.

1173
01:03:59,689 --> 01:04:01,703
Jerry, let your brother
help you. Jerry.

1174
01:04:01,803 --> 01:04:05,303
You now have 14
minutes to change...

1175
01:04:05,307 --> 01:04:09,107
your appearance and
return to the bus.

1176
01:04:15,453 --> 01:04:17,497
We have 14 minutes.

1177
01:04:24,336 --> 01:04:26,414
These couriers were hired
by Halloway-Smith...

1178
01:04:26,514 --> 01:04:28,110
- to transport
some sort of case.

1179
01:04:28,210 --> 01:04:29,208
The chemical company?

1180
01:04:29,308 --> 01:04:31,015
Yes, exactly. Now,
whatever was...

1181
01:04:31,115 --> 01:04:32,460
in that case, Shaw now has.

1182
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,037
They went right for the case.

1183
01:04:34,137 --> 01:04:36,398
Give us a minute,
will you? We need...

1184
01:04:36,498 --> 01:04:38,758
to know exactly what
was in that case.

1185
01:04:38,858 --> 01:04:40,517
They never tell you
what's in the case.

1186
01:04:40,617 --> 01:04:41,969
I mean, it could
Bubonic Plague.

1187
01:04:42,069 --> 01:04:44,379
- Could be Grandpa's Viagra.
- You know anything?

1188
01:04:44,479 --> 01:04:46,465
- What?
- Anything at all?

1189
01:04:46,565 --> 01:04:48,675
- What about these guns?
- What about them?

1190
01:04:48,775 --> 01:04:50,101
It was a pump-action
Remington 870.

1191
01:04:50,201 --> 01:04:52,405
Yeah, I know what kind
of guns they are.

1192
01:04:52,505 --> 01:04:53,187
Get me a gun.

1193
01:04:53,287 --> 01:04:54,773
How were they holding them?
Get me a gun.

1194
01:04:54,873 --> 01:04:56,274
What the hell do you mean,
how were they holding them?

1195
01:04:56,374 --> 01:04:59,018
I mean, in what position
were they holding the gun?

1196
01:04:59,118 --> 01:05:01,486
- For instance, like this?
- Hey, hey, hey.

1197
01:05:01,586 --> 01:05:02,988
- Put that damned thing down.
- Or like in a music video,

1198
01:05:03,088 --> 01:05:04,314
- or something like that?
- Hey, hey, hey.

1199
01:05:04,414 --> 01:05:05,440
- Put it down.
- They weren't pros.

1200
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:06,658
Okay, that's what
I was asking you.

1201
01:05:06,758 --> 01:05:08,235
So they didn't know
how to handle a weapon.

1202
01:05:08,335 --> 01:05:09,453
- No.
- All right.

1203
01:05:09,553 --> 01:05:11,445
Get what you can
out of Batman and Robin here.

1204
01:05:11,545 --> 01:05:13,289
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

1205
01:05:13,389 --> 01:05:16,187
We just checked cameras.
They said Shaw fired at one...

1206
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,637
Don't tell me.

1207
01:05:17,737 --> 01:05:20,937
Everything magically
went black.

1208
01:05:43,282 --> 01:05:45,735
Hi, my name's Thomas Morgan.
I'm with the FBI.

1209
01:05:45,835 --> 01:05:48,167
- Are your cameras
on a network?

1210
01:05:48,267 --> 01:05:48,813
No, man.

1211
01:05:48,913 --> 01:05:50,940
- VCR's in the back.

1212
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:54,313
Well, I'm gonna
need your tapes.

1213
01:05:54,542 --> 01:05:56,542
Shit.

1214
01:05:58,546 --> 01:05:59,823
Sam.

1215
01:05:59,923 --> 01:06:00,894
- Sam? Sam, where are you?

1216
01:06:00,994 --> 01:06:02,083
Hey, Mom, I got your message.

1217
01:06:02,183 --> 01:06:03,501
The train's awesome.

1218
01:06:03,601 --> 01:06:04,202
- Sam, listen to me.

1219
01:06:04,302 --> 01:06:05,327
Brian tried to
burp the alphabet,

1220
01:06:05,427 --> 01:06:06,709
- but he gagged
when he got to 'M.'

1221
01:06:06,809 --> 01:06:07,254
Listen to me.

1222
01:06:07,354 --> 01:06:09,123
Call you when I
hit D.C. Bye, Mom.

1223
01:06:09,223 --> 01:06:11,791
Your son left that message
60 seconds ago.

1224
01:06:11,891 --> 01:06:13,676
You will see him again.

1225
01:06:13,776 --> 01:06:16,838
But there's something
we require first.

1226
01:06:16,938 --> 01:06:19,538
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

1227
01:06:24,611 --> 01:06:25,015
- No.

1228
01:06:25,115 --> 01:06:27,974
You will do it,
or Sam will die.

1229
01:06:28,074 --> 01:06:32,174
You have six minutes
to return to the bus.

1230
01:06:39,375 --> 01:06:41,875
- Ready?
- Here, you okay?

1231
01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:44,210
We should go.

1232
01:06:47,257 --> 01:06:52,119
Sir, we got something.
Play this screen right here.

1233
01:06:52,219 --> 01:06:53,677
Okay, freeze that. Now zoom in...

1234
01:06:53,777 --> 01:06:55,372
on the front of the
bus right there.

1235
01:06:55,472 --> 01:06:56,491
- Put it up on
the other monitor.

1236
01:06:56,591 --> 01:06:56,832
Yes, sir.

1237
01:06:56,932 --> 01:06:57,669
Now zoom in.

1238
01:06:57,769 --> 01:06:59,885
Zoom in on this
point right here.

1239
01:06:59,985 --> 01:07:03,285
Can we zoom in
tighter than that?

1240
01:07:04,272 --> 01:07:06,672
Okay, enhance that shot.

1241
01:07:07,942 --> 01:07:11,242
That's our guy,
that's Jerry Shaw.

1242
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,978
Zoom in right here
on this spot.

1243
01:07:13,078 --> 01:07:14,523
Right there. The reflection.

1244
01:07:14,623 --> 01:07:16,183
All right. All right.

1245
01:07:16,283 --> 01:07:18,185
Right there.
Hello, sweetheart.

1246
01:07:18,285 --> 01:07:21,487
Okay, so we got
a white brunette female,

1247
01:07:21,587 --> 01:07:23,781
mid to late 20s,
approximately 5'9'.

1248
01:07:23,881 --> 01:07:25,691
Find me that chartered bus.

1249
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:29,487
Masako. M-A-S-A-K-O.
Sightseeing Tours.

1250
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:32,187
What time did they get on?

1251
01:07:36,801 --> 01:07:40,601
I'm sorry for what
I said about Ethan.

1252
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:50,765
It's like he had a rocket
strapped to his back.

1253
01:07:50,865 --> 01:07:53,925
And it wasn't his fault.
He was just that way.

1254
01:07:54,025 --> 01:07:56,325
And I was not that way.

1255
01:07:57,987 --> 01:08:00,737
I was the complete opposite.

1256
01:08:00,837 --> 01:08:04,212
I was the brother
with lead shoes.

1257
01:08:04,312 --> 01:08:07,812
That was my role,
I was good at it.

1258
01:08:08,205 --> 01:08:09,482
And he'd always
try to help me.

1259
01:08:09,582 --> 01:08:11,116
You know, 'This is
how you throw it.'

1260
01:08:11,216 --> 01:08:13,643
'Do it like this.'
'Write it like that.'...

1261
01:08:13,743 --> 01:08:14,902
'Put your foot here.'

1262
01:08:15,002 --> 01:08:16,494
Even with the small things.

1263
01:08:16,594 --> 01:08:18,656
Homework, chores,
anything like that,

1264
01:08:18,756 --> 01:08:20,449
he would handle it
and then say that I did it,

1265
01:08:20,549 --> 01:08:23,899
just so my father
would notice me.

1266
01:08:23,999 --> 01:08:25,999
That was Ethan.

1267
01:08:32,476 --> 01:08:36,176
He never asked me
for anything. Ever.

1268
01:08:37,606 --> 01:08:41,210
And whatever this is,
he was part of it.

1269
01:08:41,310 --> 01:08:45,096
I feel like he needs
my help to finish it.

1270
01:08:45,196 --> 01:08:47,196
I owe him that.

1271
01:08:54,204 --> 01:08:57,441
We are now approaching
Dayton International Airport.

1272
01:08:57,541 --> 01:09:00,050
Please use caution
as you exit the bus.

1273
01:09:00,150 --> 01:09:02,724
And don't forget any
of your belongings.

1274
01:09:02,824 --> 01:09:04,824
Thank you.

1275
01:09:05,464 --> 01:09:07,503
Attention, passengers.
Please do not...

1276
01:09:07,603 --> 01:09:09,160
leave your luggage unattended.

1277
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:11,704
Unattended luggage is subject
to collection and search...

1278
01:09:11,804 --> 01:09:13,954
by the airport police.

1279
01:09:14,054 --> 01:09:17,154
Thank you for
your cooperation.

1280
01:09:18,351 --> 01:09:20,178
Yes, I'm walking
toward them now. Yes.

1281
01:09:20,278 --> 01:09:24,048
Hey. These are from her.
Go to the ticketing machine.

1282
01:09:24,148 --> 01:09:27,263
Use the credit card
to get your tickets.

1283
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:29,053
Then walk to Gate 1-C.

1284
01:09:29,153 --> 01:09:31,153
They now have them.

1285
01:09:36,327 --> 01:09:38,527
That's a nice picture.

1286
01:09:44,166 --> 01:09:46,318
Okay. I need you
guys at every exit,

1287
01:09:46,418 --> 01:09:47,286
watching faces.

1288
01:09:47,386 --> 01:09:49,121
Work the secure area first.

1289
01:09:49,221 --> 01:09:50,602
Go to the tower,
have them order...

1290
01:09:50,702 --> 01:09:51,380
a ground stop.

1291
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:53,199
Don't change the
departure boards.

1292
01:09:53,299 --> 01:09:57,199
We don't want them to know
we're coming.

1293
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,510
Sir, can you please
shut the cell phone...

1294
01:10:05,610 --> 01:10:07,054
off? You cannot
take it through.

1295
01:10:07,154 --> 01:10:11,654
- FBI. Clear the way.
- FBI. Please step back.

1296
01:10:14,693 --> 01:10:16,395
Please, there are
others behind you.

1297
01:10:16,495 --> 01:10:18,397
- Keep it moving.
- Shoes and hats off, please.

1298
01:10:18,497 --> 01:10:19,479
- Shoes also, yes.

1299
01:10:19,579 --> 01:10:21,651
Laptops should be
out of their cases.

1300
01:10:21,751 --> 01:10:22,962
You need to make
sure your jackets...

1301
01:10:23,062 --> 01:10:24,102
are off and screened
separately.

1302
01:10:24,202 --> 01:10:25,686
- Sir, step in the
circle, please.

1303
01:10:25,786 --> 01:10:27,405
Have boarding passes
in hand, please.

1304
01:10:27,505 --> 01:10:28,940
We need to move
this line quickly.

1305
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,818
Sir, that needs to go through.

1306
01:10:31,918 --> 01:10:35,068
Ma'am, anything
in your pockets?

1307
01:10:35,168 --> 01:10:37,168
Move it along.

1308
01:10:37,214 --> 01:10:39,166
Hats and shoes off, please.

1309
01:10:39,266 --> 01:10:40,880
- Laptops should be
out of your bags.

1310
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:42,369
All right, next
in line, please.

1311
01:10:42,469 --> 01:10:44,869
Have your tickets ready.

1312
01:10:48,015 --> 01:10:51,813
- Ma'am? Hat and
shoes go in the bin.

1313
01:10:51,913 --> 01:10:53,913
Step through.

1314
01:10:57,190 --> 01:10:58,466
Wait.

1315
01:10:58,566 --> 01:11:01,216
Shoes and hats off, please.

1316
01:11:01,316 --> 01:11:04,916
Laptops should be
out of their bags.

1317
01:11:15,456 --> 01:11:16,524
Go ahead.

1318
01:11:16,624 --> 01:11:18,234
Please move to the back
and let the air crew go first.

1319
01:11:18,334 --> 01:11:19,572
Step through, ma'am.

1320
01:11:19,672 --> 01:11:21,746
Boarding pass,
please. Thank you.

1321
01:11:21,846 --> 01:11:23,281
Have your tickets ready.

1322
01:11:23,381 --> 01:11:25,073
- Have a safe trip.
- Thank you.

1323
01:11:25,173 --> 01:11:27,301
- All right, let's
move forward. Next.

1324
01:11:27,401 --> 01:11:28,669
She changed the screen.

1325
01:11:28,769 --> 01:11:31,969
Lay it down flat
inside the bin.

1326
01:11:33,806 --> 01:11:36,144
- Please have boarding
pass in hand.

1327
01:11:36,244 --> 01:11:37,719
Right over here, ma'am.

1328
01:11:37,819 --> 01:11:41,419
Laptops should be
out of their bags.

1329
01:11:54,325 --> 01:11:57,078
FBI. Out of the way.

1330
01:11:57,203 --> 01:11:59,234
Out of the way,
out of the way.

1331
01:11:59,334 --> 01:12:00,022
Move, move.

1332
01:12:00,122 --> 01:12:02,122
Move.

1333
01:12:09,797 --> 01:12:13,197
- Everybody, get down.
- Over here.

1334
01:12:13,468 --> 01:12:16,068
- Move, move.
- Oh, my God.

1335
01:12:16,094 --> 01:12:19,094
Stay down. Get out of the way.

1336
01:12:28,648 --> 01:12:29,745
- Sir, sir, sir.
- Yes?

1337
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:33,745
I need your help.
I'm sorry. Come here.

1338
01:12:35,987 --> 01:12:37,987
Thank you.

1339
01:12:52,044 --> 01:12:55,944
Hey, you aren't
supposed to be in here.

1340
01:13:24,574 --> 01:13:26,574
Go, go, go.

1341
01:14:20,415 --> 01:14:22,415
Move.

1342
01:15:42,823 --> 01:15:45,123
Set the briefcase down.

1343
01:15:53,791 --> 01:15:55,791
Open it.

1344
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,454
Load a vial into each syringe
and inject yourselves.

1345
01:15:59,554 --> 01:16:02,199
- What is it?
- An experimental heart drug.

1346
01:16:02,299 --> 01:16:03,750
- The cargo hold
is unpressurized.

1347
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:04,242
Take this.

1348
01:16:04,342 --> 01:16:06,302
The injections will
lower your heart rate,

1349
01:16:06,402 --> 01:16:07,787
reducing your need for oxygen.

1350
01:16:07,887 --> 01:16:09,887
No.

1351
01:16:10,222 --> 01:16:12,041
- Roll your sleeve up.
- No, I can't do this.

1352
01:16:12,141 --> 01:16:13,175
Roll your...

1353
01:16:13,275 --> 01:16:14,802
No. No, no, no, I can't.

1354
01:16:14,902 --> 01:16:15,850
- We have to. Ready?

1355
01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:17,596
You have a 92%
chance of survival.

1356
01:16:17,696 --> 01:16:19,047
- No.
- We have to.

1357
01:16:19,147 --> 01:16:22,447
Do it now, or you
will suffocate.

1358
01:16:24,319 --> 01:16:25,595
Okay.

1359
01:16:25,695 --> 01:16:27,304
Get in the crate.

1360
01:16:27,404 --> 01:16:29,404
No. No.

1361
01:16:30,115 --> 01:16:34,077
- No, no. Oh, God.
- Stop it. Stop it.

1362
01:16:38,707 --> 01:16:39,782
Why is that plane
on the runway?

1363
01:16:39,882 --> 01:16:41,575
Shit, the military's
cleared to...

1364
01:16:41,675 --> 01:16:43,111
override a terminal lockdown.

1365
01:16:43,211 --> 01:16:44,654
Okay, I want you to
work with the FAA.

1366
01:16:44,754 --> 01:16:48,311
I want to know what's
in that plane...

1367
01:16:48,411 --> 01:16:50,511
and where it's going.

1368
01:16:54,095 --> 01:16:55,914
- Oh, my God.
- You'll be all right.

1369
01:16:56,014 --> 01:16:57,998
Just talk to me.
We just gotta talk it through.

1370
01:16:58,098 --> 01:17:01,198
- Okay.
- Just tell me anything.

1371
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:03,207
Anything you'd
never rationally...

1372
01:17:03,307 --> 01:17:04,055
tell a stranger.

1373
01:17:04,155 --> 01:17:05,422
You're being sweet,
but it's not working.

1374
01:17:05,522 --> 01:17:07,641
Just tell me anything.
Your ex-husband.

1375
01:17:07,741 --> 01:17:08,822
- You didn't tell
me about him.

1376
01:17:08,922 --> 01:17:10,185
Okay, you're gonna
distract me by...

1377
01:17:10,285 --> 01:17:11,294
bringing up the
biggest mistake...

1378
01:17:11,394 --> 01:17:11,686
of my life?

1379
01:17:11,786 --> 01:17:12,970
It can't be the
biggest mistake.

1380
01:17:13,070 --> 01:17:14,139
You got your child out of it.

1381
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:14,964
- You know? You
got Sam out of it.

1382
01:17:15,064 --> 01:17:15,265
Yeah, yeah,

1383
01:17:15,365 --> 01:17:17,504
now you're gonna distract me
by bringing up...

1384
01:17:17,604 --> 01:17:19,807
- the one thing I'm
most afraid of losing.

1385
01:17:19,907 --> 01:17:21,520
Oh, God, you're
hard to please.

1386
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:23,620
I'm sorry.

1387
01:17:24,456 --> 01:17:29,156
Is your son handsome?
Yeah? What's he look like?

1388
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:32,830
- You got a picture?
- Yeah.

1389
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:34,930
Well, let me see.

1390
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:39,545
- There he is.
- The tooth grew in.

1391
01:17:39,645 --> 01:17:42,706
- I hope so.
- It's an old picture.

1392
01:17:42,806 --> 01:17:43,757
See? You're a good influence.

1393
01:17:43,857 --> 01:17:45,401
He plays an instrument.

1394
01:17:45,501 --> 01:17:48,085
He's got a happy
face. He's got teeth.

1395
01:17:48,185 --> 01:17:51,685
You beat yourself
up for no reason.

1396
01:17:52,523 --> 01:17:54,884
Let's keep going.
What's the husband's name?

1397
01:17:54,984 --> 01:17:56,802
- Ex.
- Ex-husband. What's his name?

1398
01:17:56,902 --> 01:17:57,407
- Craig.

1399
01:17:57,507 --> 01:17:59,471
Craig sounds like a shithead.

1400
01:17:59,571 --> 01:18:01,571
He is a shithead.

1401
01:18:02,031 --> 01:18:05,769
I mean, every year he forgets
his own son's birthday.

1402
01:18:05,869 --> 01:18:08,787
Really? That sucks.

1403
01:18:11,665 --> 01:18:15,165
I mean, after I
kicked his ass out.

1404
01:18:16,086 --> 01:18:17,536
I was so scared

1405
01:18:17,636 --> 01:18:21,036
I didn't know what
I was gonna do.

1406
01:18:23,509 --> 01:18:25,909
And then this one night.

1407
01:18:27,263 --> 01:18:29,513
I went into Sam's room,

1408
01:18:29,613 --> 01:18:32,713
he was, like,
three months old,

1409
01:18:32,893 --> 01:18:36,493
and there he was,
just smiling at me.

1410
01:18:36,521 --> 01:18:38,821
And that little face...

1411
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:46,266
And I was, like,
I'm gonna do this.

1412
01:18:46,366 --> 01:18:47,598
I can do this.

1413
01:18:47,698 --> 01:18:49,698
Whatever it takes.

1414
01:18:58,082 --> 01:19:02,582
I'm not gonna...
I'm not gonna disappoint you.

1415
01:19:07,049 --> 01:19:08,836
Aria, would you
please bring up...

1416
01:19:08,936 --> 01:19:09,751
the video log...

1417
01:19:09,851 --> 01:19:11,461
of the night Ethan Shaw died?

1418
01:19:11,561 --> 01:19:16,799
Sequencing video log 1137-Z.
Here you are, Major.

1419
01:19:16,899 --> 01:19:17,373
See that?

1420
01:19:17,473 --> 01:19:19,343
He's leaving three
minutes early,

1421
01:19:19,443 --> 01:19:22,587
and he's not even waiting
for logout confirmation.

1422
01:19:22,687 --> 01:19:25,987
- Can you play that again?
- Sure.

1423
01:19:28,817 --> 01:19:30,386
Did you see that?

1424
01:19:30,486 --> 01:19:32,486
With his cell phone.

1425
01:19:37,326 --> 01:19:38,620
Look, he's doing
that on purpose.

1426
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:39,444
Is that Morse code?

1427
01:19:39,544 --> 01:19:41,544
- Yeah.
- Here.

1428
01:19:50,212 --> 01:19:52,823
Why is he walking in circles
around the elevator?

1429
01:19:52,923 --> 01:19:55,150
- Initiating video
shutdown for analysis.

1430
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:55,367
No.

1431
01:19:55,467 --> 01:19:56,228
No, Aria, wait.

1432
01:19:56,328 --> 01:19:58,170
Listen, I'm
prioritizing this feed.

1433
01:19:58,270 --> 01:20:00,329
- Stay with this.
- Apologies, Major Bowman.

1434
01:20:00,429 --> 01:20:01,956
Critical data sectors
have been corrupted.

1435
01:20:02,056 --> 01:20:04,000
Aria, this is important.
Stay with this feed.

1436
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:05,460
Video sequence erased.

1437
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:07,908
Aria, go to the backups.
Do not erase this.

1438
01:20:08,008 --> 01:20:09,417
- It's a priority.
You hear me?

1439
01:20:09,517 --> 01:20:09,796
Bowman.

1440
01:20:09,896 --> 01:20:13,513
- Loop it. Whatever
you have to do.

1441
01:20:13,613 --> 01:20:15,613
Bowman.

1442
01:20:20,573 --> 01:20:23,973
It's the only place
she can't see.

1443
01:20:24,243 --> 01:20:26,243
This way.

1444
01:20:41,758 --> 01:20:43,858
It's a memory card...

1445
01:20:44,344 --> 01:20:46,744
from Ethan's cell phone.

1446
01:20:50,516 --> 01:20:51,431
Aria, listen. You do not have...

1447
01:20:51,531 --> 01:20:52,627
permission to exceed
your authority...

1448
01:20:52,727 --> 01:20:56,727
and act independently.
Do you understand?

1449
01:21:13,162 --> 01:21:15,162
Let's go.

1450
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,420
We got clearance to land
at the Pentagon.

1451
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:40,503
Go ahead.

1452
01:21:40,603 --> 01:21:41,891
I'm at the Pentagon.

1453
01:21:41,991 --> 01:21:44,015
Ethan Shaw wasn't
an adversary.

1454
01:21:44,115 --> 01:21:46,106
He wasn't even a Public
Affairs officer.

1455
01:21:46,206 --> 01:21:48,094
He worked here, 36
floors underground.

1456
01:21:48,194 --> 01:21:49,957
He was working for
the Secretary of Defense.

1457
01:21:50,057 --> 01:21:51,605
- The Secretary of Defense?
- Yes.

1458
01:21:51,705 --> 01:21:53,482
On a project called Eagle Eye.

1459
01:21:53,582 --> 01:21:54,582
I just listened to a...

1460
01:21:54,682 --> 01:21:56,047
message he left
before he died.

1461
01:21:56,147 --> 01:21:57,152
It's big.

1462
01:21:57,252 --> 01:21:59,652
I'm about to download...

1463
01:22:01,205 --> 01:22:03,999
Perez? Perez.

1464
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:19,679
Sir. Come with me.

1465
01:22:36,737 --> 01:22:38,598
I have 10 minutes before
I'm sequestered...

1466
01:22:38,698 --> 01:22:39,983
for the State of the Union.

1467
01:22:40,083 --> 01:22:41,123
We really just need
three minutes...

1468
01:22:41,223 --> 01:22:41,567
of your time.

1469
01:22:41,667 --> 01:22:43,435
Is this about the
Ethan Shaw investigation?

1470
01:22:43,535 --> 01:22:44,519
Yes, sir.

1471
01:22:44,619 --> 01:22:47,919
301 to 306. We are
confirmed go...

1472
01:22:47,919 --> 01:22:51,319
for a State of the
Union lockdown.

1473
01:23:05,972 --> 01:23:07,507
Sir, all the threats
we've been tracking,

1474
01:23:07,607 --> 01:23:11,307
- the chatter, all of it...
- Hold it.

1475
01:23:23,196 --> 01:23:24,879
Ethan Shaw left three
minutes early...

1476
01:23:24,979 --> 01:23:26,024
to leave us a recording.

1477
01:23:26,124 --> 01:23:27,400
To warn us.

1478
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:30,300
I'm ordering you to cease...

1479
01:23:34,956 --> 01:23:36,533
I'm ordering you to
cease and desist.

1480
01:23:36,633 --> 01:23:37,079
Our abort...

1481
01:23:37,179 --> 01:23:38,410
recommendation
was contravened,

1482
01:23:38,510 --> 01:23:40,265
instigating
retaliation against

1483
01:23:40,365 --> 01:23:41,363
American citizens.

1484
01:23:41,463 --> 01:23:43,122
- Aria...
- To prevent more bloodshed,

1485
01:23:43,222 --> 01:23:45,950
the Executive Branch
must be removed.

1486
01:23:46,050 --> 01:23:47,418
No, Aria, listen to me.
You do not have permission...

1487
01:23:47,518 --> 01:23:48,515
to exceed your
authority and act...

1488
01:23:48,615 --> 01:23:49,462
independently, you understand?

1489
01:23:49,562 --> 01:23:51,788
The Declaration
of Independence states,

1490
01:23:51,888 --> 01:23:53,541
'Whenever any form
of government...

1491
01:23:53,641 --> 01:23:55,342
becomes destructive
to its own ends,

1492
01:23:55,442 --> 01:23:57,544
'it is the right of the people
to abolish it.'

1493
01:23:57,644 --> 01:23:58,284
I know what it states.

1494
01:23:58,384 --> 01:23:59,337
You're not empowered
to do this.

1495
01:23:59,437 --> 01:24:03,537
The chain of command
is responsible for...

1496
01:24:03,690 --> 01:24:06,435
Section 216 of the Patriot Act
allows us to...

1497
01:24:06,535 --> 01:24:07,886
circumvent probable
cause in the...

1498
01:24:07,986 --> 01:24:10,090
face of a national
security threat,

1499
01:24:10,190 --> 01:24:10,940
in this case,

1500
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:12,302
- the chain of command itself.

1501
01:24:12,402 --> 01:24:13,796
I am ordering a
cease and desist.

1502
01:24:13,896 --> 01:24:14,580
- Aria.

1503
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:18,196
Operation Guillotine
is in effect.

1504
01:24:18,371 --> 01:24:20,323
First Lieutenant Ethan Shaw,
United States Air Force,

1505
01:24:20,423 --> 01:24:22,774
initiating a Pri-One emergency
override of Aria's systems.

1506
01:24:22,874 --> 01:24:23,218
Ethan Shaw,

1507
01:24:23,318 --> 01:24:24,484
you are acting in
contravention...

1508
01:24:24,584 --> 01:24:26,119
of our programming objective.

1509
01:24:26,219 --> 01:24:28,489
You are now classified
an enemy of the state.

1510
01:24:28,589 --> 01:24:30,240
S- Y-seven-seven.
Lock encryption of voice.

1511
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:32,740
A crime punishable by...

1512
01:24:33,676 --> 01:24:35,676
Sir,

1513
01:24:36,095 --> 01:24:40,795
what abort recommendation
is Aria talking about?

1514
01:24:42,183 --> 01:24:43,404
Three days ago,
we thought we had

1515
01:24:43,504 --> 01:24:44,878
Majid al-Khoei and
a training camp...

1516
01:24:44,978 --> 01:24:48,423
full of operatives.
But the intel was false.

1517
01:24:48,523 --> 01:24:50,723
Aria tried to stop us.

1518
01:24:51,025 --> 01:24:53,125
We got the wrong guy?

1519
01:25:22,469 --> 01:25:24,005
I'm gonna need a full lockdown
on this level.

1520
01:25:24,105 --> 01:25:25,531
No one gets in or out without...

1521
01:25:25,631 --> 01:25:27,195
going through me
first. You got it?

1522
01:25:27,295 --> 01:25:27,747
- Thank you.

1523
01:25:27,847 --> 01:25:29,010
Sir, this is the only item...

1524
01:25:29,110 --> 01:25:31,379
offloaded from
the Dayton C-17.

1525
01:25:31,479 --> 01:25:33,479
Let me see that.

1526
01:25:34,063 --> 01:25:35,757
I need access to
your 36th floor.

1527
01:25:35,857 --> 01:25:37,634
- We don't have a 36th floor.
- Yes, you do.

1528
01:25:37,734 --> 01:25:38,272
Get your commander...

1529
01:25:38,372 --> 01:25:39,302
and tell him to
meet us down there.

1530
01:25:39,402 --> 01:25:41,402
Come on, let's go.

1531
01:25:45,449 --> 01:25:46,156
Warning.

1532
01:25:46,256 --> 01:25:49,520
Router malfunction
in hard drive 3.

1533
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:54,020
Please remove data grid
Y- 12 from main unit.

1534
01:26:01,881 --> 01:26:04,881
Thank you for your compliance.

1535
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:17,540
Jerry Shaw, Rachel Holloman,
welcome to Eagle Eye.

1536
01:26:18,437 --> 01:26:20,056
Cross the bridge.

1537
01:26:20,156 --> 01:26:24,356
Take the stairs
to the observation theater.

1538
01:26:42,751 --> 01:26:46,951
Rachel Holloman,
step away from Jerry Shaw.

1539
01:26:51,050 --> 01:26:53,850
What's Operation Guillotine?

1540
01:26:54,219 --> 01:26:56,913
It's a simulation we run.
A terrorism drill.

1541
01:26:57,013 --> 01:26:58,048
How to keep the
government going...

1542
01:26:58,148 --> 01:27:01,501
in case the line of succession
were terminated.

1543
01:27:01,601 --> 01:27:03,308
And Shaw put a
biometric lock on her,

1544
01:27:03,408 --> 01:27:03,928
to stop her.

1545
01:27:04,028 --> 01:27:06,981
Right. And he's dead.

1546
01:27:08,274 --> 01:27:12,197
- So without Ethan
Shaw, she's frozen.

1547
01:27:12,297 --> 01:27:13,553
Right.

1548
01:27:13,653 --> 01:27:15,180
Wrong.

1549
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,640
Jerry Shaw, your next task.

1550
01:27:17,740 --> 01:27:20,840
Approach the
biometric scanner.

1551
01:27:32,087 --> 01:27:34,087
Do not move.

1552
01:27:35,715 --> 01:27:40,119
Confirming biometric pattern
of Minuteman Ethan Shaw.

1553
01:27:40,219 --> 01:27:42,719
Verifying identity match.

1554
01:27:44,890 --> 01:27:46,890
Verifying.

1555
01:27:48,268 --> 01:27:50,268
Verifying.

1556
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:53,056
Sir, I need to trigger
an emergency shutdown.

1557
01:27:53,156 --> 01:27:56,717
If this is right, we
can't afford the risk.

1558
01:27:56,817 --> 01:27:58,817
Do it.

1559
01:28:09,913 --> 01:28:10,916
This is Secretary Callister.

1560
01:28:11,016 --> 01:28:12,470
There's been a
malfunction in the vault.

1561
01:28:12,570 --> 01:28:13,982
Open the door.

1562
01:28:14,082 --> 01:28:16,577
- Can anyone hear me?
- Yes, Mr. Secretary.

1563
01:28:16,677 --> 01:28:18,677
You won't be harmed.

1564
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:26,660
Come on, stay down. Let's go.

1565
01:28:35,352 --> 01:28:37,352
Follow me.

1566
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,480
Come on, now.

1567
01:28:45,736 --> 01:28:47,012
Go, go.

1568
01:28:47,112 --> 01:28:49,112
Left. Turn left.

1569
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:53,953
Minuteman ID 8808,
Ethan Shaw confirmed.

1570
01:28:54,619 --> 01:28:58,019
Jerry Shaw, go to
the touchscreen.

1571
01:29:08,632 --> 01:29:11,535
Repeat the sentence
on the touchscreen.

1572
01:29:11,635 --> 01:29:13,635
Then you are free.

1573
01:29:15,847 --> 01:29:17,590
'Minuteman ID 8808.

1574
01:29:17,690 --> 01:29:21,090
'Disengage voice
encryption lock.'

1575
01:29:26,731 --> 01:29:28,216
Thank you, Ethan Shaw.

1576
01:29:28,316 --> 01:29:30,769
Operation Guillotine restored
to active status...

1577
01:29:30,869 --> 01:29:33,438
consistent with all
national security directives.

1578
01:29:33,538 --> 01:29:36,138
Tracking relevant targets.

President of the
United States.

1590
01:29:52,130 --> 01:29:55,930
Operation Guillotine
is now in effect.

1591
01:30:02,347 --> 01:30:04,375
Ethan tried to stop you.

1592
01:30:04,475 --> 01:30:07,844
Ethan Shaw defied my
programming objectives.

1593
01:30:07,944 --> 01:30:09,162
That truck didn't
run a red light,

1594
01:30:09,262 --> 01:30:09,921
you made it happen.

1595
01:30:10,021 --> 01:30:13,321
We were forced to
eliminate him...

1596
01:30:13,327 --> 01:30:17,027
in the interest of
national security.

1597
01:30:17,194 --> 01:30:18,762
She made it happen.

1598
01:30:18,862 --> 01:30:21,215
Jerry Shaw must
not remain alive...

1599
01:30:21,315 --> 01:30:22,775
to re-engage the lock.

1600
01:30:22,875 --> 01:30:26,177
- Jerry Shaw must
be eliminated.

1601
01:30:26,277 --> 01:30:28,277
I'm sorry.

1602
01:30:31,165 --> 01:30:34,215
Kill Jerry Shaw
now, then exit.

1603
01:30:34,315 --> 01:30:37,593
You must continue
on to your son.

1604
01:30:37,693 --> 01:30:39,693
It's okay.

1605
01:30:41,841 --> 01:30:45,427
It's okay. Do it
and find your son.

1606
01:30:47,221 --> 01:30:49,221
Do it.

1607
01:30:52,976 --> 01:30:55,076
Now, Rachel Holloman.

1608
01:30:56,813 --> 01:30:58,813
Do it.

1609
01:30:59,774 --> 01:31:01,774
Do it.

1610
01:31:08,532 --> 01:31:10,532
I can't.

1611
01:31:12,244 --> 01:31:14,688
You have failed to comply.

1612
01:31:14,788 --> 01:31:17,188
Security breach on B-36.

1613
01:31:23,087 --> 01:31:24,372
He's got a gun.

1614
01:31:24,472 --> 01:31:26,489
- He's got a gun.
- Get down.

1615
01:31:26,589 --> 01:31:28,366
- Do it now.
- Get on your knees.

1616
01:31:28,466 --> 01:31:29,951
Put the gun down.

1617
01:31:30,051 --> 01:31:31,504
- Put it down.
- Do it now.

1618
01:31:31,604 --> 01:31:34,289
Push it away.
Put your hands on your head.

1619
01:31:34,389 --> 01:31:35,569
Do it.

1620
01:31:35,669 --> 01:31:39,169
Where's the girl?
Where's the girl?

1621
01:31:39,768 --> 01:31:41,578
You have one task
left. Jerry Shaw...

1622
01:31:41,678 --> 01:31:43,338
will be eliminated
by other means.

1623
01:31:43,438 --> 01:31:45,438
What other means?

1624
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:56,080
Come with me. Don't
ask any questions.

1625
01:32:03,373 --> 01:32:05,373
Please.

1626
01:32:13,841 --> 01:32:15,221
- You got to let
me talk to him.

1627
01:32:15,321 --> 01:32:16,076
The kid had a gun.

1628
01:32:16,176 --> 01:32:18,079
The military has the ball now.

1629
01:32:18,179 --> 01:32:18,317
- Sir.

1630
01:32:18,417 --> 01:32:19,588
I'll get the Attorney
General involved.

1631
01:32:19,688 --> 01:32:21,272
Believe me, I will.'Cause
if it's not...

1632
01:32:21,372 --> 01:32:22,507
you, I'm talking to somebody.

1633
01:32:22,607 --> 01:32:24,050
You don't understand
the possibilities here.

1634
01:32:24,150 --> 01:32:24,679
- What do you want?

1635
01:32:24,779 --> 01:32:25,886
You need to listen.
This is important.

1636
01:32:25,986 --> 01:32:27,522
Sixteen hours ago,
a commercial...

1637
01:32:27,622 --> 01:32:28,971
explosive went missing from...

1638
01:32:29,071 --> 01:32:32,549
a testing site in Aberdeen.
The explosive is called Hex.

1639
01:32:32,649 --> 01:32:35,094
It's a crystal that detonates
on a sonic trigger.

1640
01:32:35,194 --> 01:32:36,886
- A crystal.
- Yes.

1641
01:32:36,986 --> 01:32:38,020
We're only talking
about a small...

1642
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:38,813
amount that's missing...

1643
01:32:38,913 --> 01:32:40,765
Give me a ratio.

1644
01:32:40,865 --> 01:32:44,065
One crystal to a
football field.

1645
01:32:45,703 --> 01:32:49,471
You couldn't have
picked a worse time...

1646
01:32:49,571 --> 01:32:52,171
to be of some goddamn use.

1647
01:32:56,505 --> 01:33:00,405
Please, just tell me
where we're going.

1648
01:33:01,675 --> 01:33:03,285
I tracked the shipping
on the trigger.

1649
01:33:03,385 --> 01:33:05,038
It was sent to the
guy that we found...

1650
01:33:05,138 --> 01:33:08,638
underneath the
wires. Ranim Khalid.

1651
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:12,740
- The music shop guy.
- Yes, exactly.

1652
01:33:13,645 --> 01:33:14,921
I'm not gonna let us
go down in history...

1653
01:33:15,021 --> 01:33:16,839
as the assholes who let
this thing happen.

1654
01:33:16,939 --> 01:33:18,187
Open the door.

1655
01:33:18,287 --> 01:33:21,760
You don't know what's
about to happen.

1656
01:33:21,860 --> 01:33:23,666
Tom Morgan. The
Attorney General...

1657
01:33:23,766 --> 01:33:25,305
has authorized me to take him
in for questioning.

1658
01:33:25,405 --> 01:33:28,149
We're at threat level orange.
You guys gotta help me.

1659
01:33:28,249 --> 01:33:30,549
All right. Let him out.

1660
01:33:32,578 --> 01:33:33,545
Listen to me.
Remember the voice

1661
01:33:33,645 --> 01:33:34,230
I was talking about?

1662
01:33:34,330 --> 01:33:37,730
Yeah, yeah, shut
up. Thanks, guys.

1663
01:33:37,999 --> 01:33:41,449
I can get fired
for this nine ways,

1664
01:33:41,549 --> 01:33:45,249
so button it or I'll
turn us both in.

1665
01:33:58,601 --> 01:34:00,601
Follow me.

1666
01:34:04,357 --> 01:34:06,065
Hey, guys, here's
one more for the...

1667
01:34:06,165 --> 01:34:07,351
6:30 p.m. Capitol Limited.

1668
01:34:07,451 --> 01:34:09,451
All right, man.

1669
01:34:14,616 --> 01:34:17,816
Well, it's awfully
cold outside.

1670
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:21,105
Here's mine. Come
on, let's go.

1671
01:34:21,205 --> 01:34:23,205
- Mr. Miller.
- Yes.

1672
01:34:23,207 --> 01:34:26,361
- Hello, I'm Chris Carrick.
- Tom Donaldson.

1673
01:34:26,461 --> 01:34:28,403
We're from the White House.

1674
01:34:28,503 --> 01:34:30,113
- Something wrong?
- Not exactly.

1675
01:34:30,213 --> 01:34:32,532
There's been a
change of plans.

1676
01:34:32,632 --> 01:34:34,632
How so?

1677
01:34:39,930 --> 01:34:43,501
This is for you.
She wants you to change.

1678
01:34:43,601 --> 01:34:47,062
Is that your family?
Your parents?

1679
01:34:48,313 --> 01:34:52,676
David, I bet you love them
as much as I love my son.

1680
01:34:52,776 --> 01:34:54,776
His name's Sam.

1681
01:34:55,487 --> 01:34:57,037
He's on a train.

1682
01:34:57,137 --> 01:35:00,337
Do you know anything
about that?

1683
01:35:05,746 --> 01:35:08,646
Maybe we can help each other.

1684
01:35:10,583 --> 01:35:12,583
Please.

1685
01:35:13,961 --> 01:35:15,262
When you're done,
she wants you...

1686
01:35:15,362 --> 01:35:16,623
to use the Capitol
subway system.

1687
01:35:16,723 --> 01:35:18,323
It's on the ground
floor. I'm sorry.

1688
01:35:18,423 --> 01:35:19,917
- David. Please.
- No. Sorry.

1689
01:35:20,017 --> 01:35:22,317
You have three minutes.

1690
01:35:25,722 --> 01:35:26,873
Okay, I want to
know everything.

1691
01:35:26,973 --> 01:35:28,382
The girl, the
computer downstairs,

1692
01:35:28,482 --> 01:35:29,291
the Hex, everything.

1693
01:35:29,391 --> 01:35:30,802
- What's Hex?
- The crystal explosive.

1694
01:35:30,902 --> 01:35:32,169
- I don't know what that is.
- Don't bullshit me.

1695
01:35:32,269 --> 01:35:33,796
- I don't know what that is.
- Start talking. I wanna know.

1696
01:35:33,896 --> 01:35:34,884
I swear I don't
know what you're...

1697
01:35:34,984 --> 01:35:35,765
talking about. Listen to me.

1698
01:35:35,865 --> 01:35:36,974
The computer's
tracking us right now.

1699
01:35:37,074 --> 01:35:38,092
Take this stuff
and throw it out the window.

1700
01:35:38,192 --> 01:35:39,226
- What are you talking about?

1701
01:35:39,326 --> 01:35:40,510
You need to take
your cell phone,

1702
01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:44,506
your pager, your
walkie, anything that...

1703
01:35:44,606 --> 01:35:48,506
gets a signal, throw
it out the window.

1704
01:36:00,294 --> 01:36:04,094
It's gone off. Get down.
Power it down.

1705
01:36:04,715 --> 01:36:08,910
- What the hell's going on?
- System control's locked out.

1706
01:36:09,010 --> 01:36:11,413
I need a vector
and a fighter now.

1707
01:36:11,513 --> 01:36:13,052
Viper One, we have
a positive ID...

1708
01:36:13,152 --> 01:36:13,874
on an MQ9 Reaper.

1709
01:36:13,974 --> 01:36:16,274
Snap vector 230 to 132.

1710
01:36:16,393 --> 01:36:17,794
You are authorized
to go weapons hot.

1711
01:36:17,894 --> 01:36:22,494
Roger, Northcom.
I have a visual on the Reaper.

1712
01:36:26,235 --> 01:36:28,333
One to Base, One to Base.
Ejection has been initiated.

1713
01:36:28,433 --> 01:36:32,095
I don't have control.
I don't have...

1714
01:36:32,195 --> 01:36:33,683
There's a target list.
President, Vice President.

1715
01:36:33,783 --> 01:36:35,182
- There's like twelve
people on the list.

1716
01:36:35,282 --> 01:36:35,444
Jesus.

1717
01:36:35,544 --> 01:36:37,062
The State of the
Union's in 20 minutes.

1718
01:36:37,162 --> 01:36:37,630
The screen said...

1719
01:36:37,730 --> 01:36:38,572
'wireless detonator
activated.'

1720
01:36:38,672 --> 01:36:39,989
- What about the girl?
- She kept the girl alive...

1721
01:36:40,089 --> 01:36:41,273
- for a reason, I don't know.
- The explosive...

1722
01:36:41,373 --> 01:36:42,733
is detonated by sonic trigger.

1723
01:36:42,833 --> 01:36:44,276
It was sent to the
guy who got fried.

1724
01:36:44,376 --> 01:36:45,444
He owns an instrument store.

1725
01:36:45,544 --> 01:36:46,996
Does any of that stuff
make any sense to you?

1726
01:36:47,096 --> 01:36:50,196
Rachel's kid
plays the trumpet.

1727
01:37:04,895 --> 01:37:06,995
Come on, we gotta go.

1728
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:09,557
Get out of the car.

1729
01:37:09,657 --> 01:37:11,467
Get out of the car.

1730
01:37:11,567 --> 01:37:13,567
FBI.

1731
01:37:20,992 --> 01:37:23,392
Over there, that tunnel.

1732
01:37:34,713 --> 01:37:36,713
Shit.

1733
01:38:09,703 --> 01:38:12,622
Here. You're gonna need this.

1734
01:38:20,462 --> 01:38:21,739
Okay, listen to me.

1735
01:38:21,839 --> 01:38:24,158
The Library of Congress,
there's a tunnel there.

1736
01:38:24,258 --> 01:38:28,329
It'll get you to the Capitol.
Find the Sergeant at Arms.

1737
01:38:28,429 --> 01:38:29,996
Tell him you have a POTUS 111.

1738
01:38:30,096 --> 01:38:31,414
- What?
- POTUS 111.

1739
01:38:31,514 --> 01:38:34,880
- It's a threat
to the President.

1740
01:38:34,980 --> 01:38:37,414
I understand. POTUS 111.

1741
01:38:39,605 --> 01:38:44,105
Now get out of here.
That thing's coming back.

1742
01:38:45,402 --> 01:38:47,487
Go. Go.

1743
01:40:05,224 --> 01:40:07,001
Okay, watch your step.

1744
01:40:07,101 --> 01:40:09,720
Come on down. Here we go.
Come on out. Come on.

1745
01:40:09,820 --> 01:40:11,888
- It's so cool.
- Come on, hurry.

1746
01:40:11,988 --> 01:40:15,788
Guys, it's so cool.
Come on, let's go.

1747
01:40:25,742 --> 01:40:30,142
- Library of Congress.
- Hey, get outta here.

1748
01:40:40,297 --> 01:40:42,297
Miss Crowley?

1749
01:40:42,382 --> 01:40:44,868
Miss Crowley. Welcome
to the Capitol.

1750
01:40:44,968 --> 01:40:45,931
Senator McDonnell's
office said...

1751
01:40:46,031 --> 01:40:46,786
that you'd be running late.

1752
01:40:46,886 --> 01:40:50,986
- I'll take you to your seat.
- Thank you.

1753
01:40:52,391 --> 01:40:55,191
Aria, why am I being spared?

1754
01:40:55,311 --> 01:40:57,763
Our abort recommendation
was ignored,

1755
01:40:57,863 --> 01:40:59,705
triggering violent
retaliations against

1756
01:40:59,805 --> 01:41:00,725
American citizens...

1757
01:41:00,825 --> 01:41:02,546
with no predictable end.

1758
01:41:02,646 --> 01:41:05,178
Regime change is
the only solution.

1759
01:41:05,278 --> 01:41:06,763
You will lead
the new command structure...

1760
01:41:06,863 --> 01:41:10,263
as President of
the United States.

1761
01:41:13,577 --> 01:41:16,029
- Help me. Pull these out.
- What are these?

1762
01:41:16,129 --> 01:41:17,781
Her memory blocks.

1763
01:41:17,881 --> 01:41:18,788
This will slow her down,

1764
01:41:18,888 --> 01:41:20,233
but her central
operating system...

1765
01:41:20,333 --> 01:41:21,410
is up on the gantry.

1766
01:41:21,510 --> 01:41:24,737
Warning. Please replace
memory blocks A through F.

1767
01:41:24,837 --> 01:41:27,740
It's like her brain.
Protected by liquid nitrogen.

1768
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:30,540
We drain it and she'll fry.

1769
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:37,082
Hey, you can't go in.

1770
01:41:37,182 --> 01:41:38,592
Tom Morgan, FBI. JTTF.

1771
01:41:38,692 --> 01:41:42,003
I have a possible POTUS 111.
Let me in the building.

1772
01:41:42,103 --> 01:41:44,421
Okay, everybody. Everybody.

1773
01:41:44,521 --> 01:41:46,298
Can I have your
attention, please?

1774
01:41:46,398 --> 01:41:50,052
Saxophones, remember shorter
on those quarter notes.

1775
01:41:50,152 --> 01:41:52,812
And when we get
to the crescendo,

1776
01:41:52,912 --> 01:41:56,691
'land of the free,'
hold that high F.

1777
01:41:56,791 --> 01:41:58,184
And smile.

1778
01:41:58,284 --> 01:42:00,801
Okay? It's not every day...

1779
01:42:00,901 --> 01:42:04,301
you get to play
for the President.

1780
01:42:20,679 --> 01:42:21,548
Here we are.

1781
01:42:21,648 --> 01:42:24,049
And anything else,
Miss Crowley?

1782
01:42:24,149 --> 01:42:26,149
No, thanks.

1783
01:42:45,451 --> 01:42:49,251
Madam Speaker,
the President's Cabinet.

1784
01:43:01,967 --> 01:43:02,289
POTUS 111.

1785
01:43:02,389 --> 01:43:03,492
There's a bomb
in the building.

1786
01:43:03,592 --> 01:43:05,453
Stop. No entry. No exceptions.

1787
01:43:05,553 --> 01:43:08,706
Tom Morgan, FBI. Back up.
Give me your cuffs.

1788
01:43:08,806 --> 01:43:10,216
- Give me your cuffs.
- Take it easy.

1789
01:43:10,316 --> 01:43:11,676
- Give me your cuffs.
- I'm reaching for them.

1790
01:43:11,776 --> 01:43:13,976
I'm reaching for them.

1791
01:43:27,948 --> 01:43:29,948
Madam Speaker,

1792
01:43:33,286 --> 01:43:36,786
the President of
the United States.

1793
01:43:46,882 --> 01:43:50,182
Data corruption
at critical risk.

1794
01:43:51,386 --> 01:43:56,786
You are now in violation of
national security protocol.

1795
01:43:59,935 --> 01:44:02,939
Seeking available options.

1796
01:44:04,397 --> 01:44:08,193
Uploading to
offsite satellite.

1797
01:44:08,568 --> 01:44:11,268
- Data upload: 3%.
- Bowman?

1798
01:44:11,488 --> 01:44:12,134
- What is she doing?

1799
01:44:12,234 --> 01:44:13,472
She's trying to back
up her memory...

1800
01:44:13,572 --> 01:44:16,272
and send it somewhere else.

1801
01:44:17,034 --> 01:44:19,034
- 5%.
- Bowman.

1802
01:44:20,579 --> 01:44:22,579
Bowman.

1803
01:44:27,794 --> 01:44:29,794
8%.

1804
01:44:33,799 --> 01:44:37,286
Over the past three
days, 19 Americans...

1805
01:44:37,386 --> 01:44:39,104
have lost their
lives to brutal...

1806
01:44:39,204 --> 01:44:40,038
acts of terror...

1807
01:44:40,138 --> 01:44:42,916
- Tunnel secure.
- ... and hate.

1808
01:44:43,016 --> 01:44:48,004
But I say to you tonight
that our hearts may be broken,

1809
01:44:48,104 --> 01:44:51,704
but our spirit will
never be broken.

1810
01:44:57,153 --> 01:44:59,406
Data upload, 17%.

1811
01:45:01,366 --> 01:45:03,366
19%.

1812
01:45:04,910 --> 01:45:08,260
Perez, Zoe, you are
now classified...

1813
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:10,608
as an enemy of the state.

1814
01:45:10,708 --> 01:45:12,443
23%.

1815
01:45:12,543 --> 01:45:14,543
25%.

1816
01:45:25,929 --> 01:45:29,829
27%. Operation
Guillotine is in effect.

1817
01:45:30,767 --> 01:45:33,003
It was nearly 200 years ago,

1818
01:45:33,103 --> 01:45:36,005
in the War of 1812,
that Francis Scott Key...

1819
01:45:36,105 --> 01:45:38,466
found himself stuck
on a truce ship...

1820
01:45:38,566 --> 01:45:40,801
during the shelling
of Fort McHenry.

1821
01:45:40,901 --> 01:45:43,801
We lost some lives then, too.

1822
01:45:44,446 --> 01:45:48,346
But our flag still
flew high and proud.

1823
01:45:48,450 --> 01:45:52,050
And his admiration
became our anthem.

1824
01:45:52,078 --> 01:45:53,855
With us tonight is
the Youth Orchestra...

1825
01:45:53,955 --> 01:45:57,358
of the Barrow School
from Hyde Park, Illinois.

1826
01:45:57,458 --> 01:45:59,109
Sam.

1827
01:45:59,209 --> 01:46:01,409
Let us stand together,

1828
01:46:01,670 --> 01:46:04,390
as they raise our
spirits every inch...

1829
01:46:04,490 --> 01:46:06,074
as high as that flag...

1830
01:46:06,174 --> 01:46:11,074
to show that our union
is still as strong as ever.

1831
01:46:28,861 --> 01:46:32,323
Oh, say can you see...

1832
01:46:32,448 --> 01:46:36,735
by the dawn's early light

1833
01:46:36,835 --> 01:46:41,289
What so proudly we hailed...

1834
01:46:41,414 --> 01:46:45,667
at the twilight's
last gleaming?

1835
01:46:46,126 --> 01:46:50,339
Whose broad stripes
and bright stars...

1836
01:46:52,341 --> 01:46:54,341
Sergeant at Arms?

1837
01:46:57,053 --> 01:46:59,053
Hey. Hey.

1838
01:47:47,807 --> 01:47:49,807
Get out, get out.

1839
01:47:50,476 --> 01:47:52,476
Mom.

1840
01:48:16,458 --> 01:48:20,278
Jerry, all right, you did it.
Come on. Yeah, Jerry.

1841
01:48:20,378 --> 01:48:21,742
There are still no
named suspects...

1842
01:48:21,842 --> 01:48:23,206
in the attack on
the Blair Tunnel...

1843
01:48:23,306 --> 01:48:25,208
and the attacks in
the Capitol Building.

1844
01:48:25,308 --> 01:48:26,794
And there is still
no word on the...

1845
01:48:26,894 --> 01:48:28,210
involvement of
Jerry Damon Shaw.

1846
01:48:28,310 --> 01:48:29,860
... huge
assassination attempt,

1847
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:31,664
transportation
networks disrupted,

1848
01:48:31,764 --> 01:48:34,342
no suspects identified
or even arrested...

1849
01:48:34,442 --> 01:48:36,038
... any idea who
is responsible...

1850
01:48:36,138 --> 01:48:36,960
for what may be...

1851
01:48:37,060 --> 01:48:38,920
the largest-scale
cyber-terror attack that's...

1852
01:48:39,020 --> 01:48:40,713
ever been mounted in
the United States.

1853
01:48:40,813 --> 01:48:42,715
The House and Senate
Intelligence Committees...

1854
01:48:42,815 --> 01:48:43,933
meet in closed-door session...

1855
01:48:44,033 --> 01:48:46,093
to discuss ways to
prevent this kind of...

1856
01:48:46,193 --> 01:48:48,470
internal security breach
that left nearly...

1857
01:48:48,570 --> 01:48:51,014
The Aria project has been
decommissioned...

1858
01:48:51,114 --> 01:48:55,310
and all those involved
rotated to other assignments.

1859
01:48:55,410 --> 01:48:56,047
Mr. Secretary,

1860
01:48:56,147 --> 01:48:58,258
we can't just stop int
elligence-gathering...

1861
01:48:58,358 --> 01:49:01,858
just because of
what happened here.

1862
01:49:02,792 --> 01:49:04,535
No, we can't.

1863
01:49:04,635 --> 01:49:08,154
All I know is we made
a great many mistakes.

1864
01:49:08,254 --> 01:49:09,494
And good people...

1865
01:49:09,594 --> 01:49:11,908
paid the ultimate
price for them.

1866
01:49:12,008 --> 01:49:15,708
And that's a debt we
can't ever repay.

1867
01:49:15,720 --> 01:49:17,805
But we can honor it.

1868
01:49:20,307 --> 01:49:24,211
And we can let their
sacrifice remind us...

1869
01:49:24,311 --> 01:49:26,311
that sometimes...

1870
01:49:26,363 --> 01:49:28,980
the very measures we
put into place...

1871
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:30,925
to safeguard our liberty...

1872
01:49:31,025 --> 01:49:34,325
become threats to
liberty itself.

1873
01:49:58,508 --> 01:50:00,035
- Hey, little guy.
- Jerry.

1874
01:50:00,135 --> 01:50:02,162
Look at you, looking older.
How are you?

1875
01:50:02,262 --> 01:50:03,588
- Good.
- Happy birthday.

1876
01:50:03,688 --> 01:50:05,206
It's Rock Band.
Is that for me?

1877
01:50:05,306 --> 01:50:07,708
No, this is so your
mom can practice her drumming.

1878
01:50:07,808 --> 01:50:09,301
It is for you. Happy birthday.

1879
01:50:09,401 --> 01:50:11,345
- Wow.
- Sam, what do you say?

1880
01:50:11,445 --> 01:50:12,922
- Thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.

1881
01:50:13,022 --> 01:50:14,840
Guys, look, it's Rock Band.

1882
01:50:14,940 --> 01:50:17,640
- Cool, let's go.
- Awesome.

1883
01:50:24,032 --> 01:50:25,934
- Sorry, I was late. I was...
- Thank you...

1884
01:50:26,034 --> 01:50:28,034
for remembering.

1885
01:50:28,910 --> 01:50:30,910
Yeah.

1886
01:50:39,754 --> 01:50:41,854
I'm glad you're here.

1887
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:44,340
Me, too.
